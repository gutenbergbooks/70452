  <h2 class='c013'>MEMOIR OF MAYNE REID.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c014' />
<p class='c015'>No one who has written books for the young during the
present century ever had so large a circle of readers as
Captain Mayne Reid, or ever was so well fitted by circumstances
to write the books by which he is chiefly known.
His life, which was an adventurous one, was ripened with
the experience of two Continents, and his temperament,
which was an ardent one, reflected the traits of two races.
Irish by birth, he was American in his sympathies with
the people of the New World, whose acquaintance he
made at an early period, among whom he lived for years,
and whose battles he helped to win. He was probably
more familiar with the Southern and Western portion of
the United States forty years ago than any native-born
American of that time. A curious interest attaches to the
life of Captain Reid, but it is not of the kind that casual
biographers dwell upon. If he had written it himself it
would have charmed thousands of readers, who can now
merely imagine what it might have been from the glimpses
of it which they obtain in his writings. It was not passed
in the fierce light of publicity, but in that simple, silent
obscurity which is the lot of most men, and is their happiness,
if they only knew it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Briefly related, the life of Captain Reid was as follows:
He was born in 1818, in the north of Ireland, the son of
a Presbyterian clergyman, who was a type of the class
which Goldsmith has described so freshly in the “Deserted
Village,” and was highly thought of for his labors among
the poor of his neighborhood. An earnest, reverent man,
to whom his calling was indeed a sacred one, he designed
his son Mayne for the ministry, in the hope, no doubt,
that he would be his successor. But nature had something
to say about that, as well as his good father. He
began to study for the ministry, but it was not long before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>he was drawn in another direction. Always a great reader,
his favorite books were descriptions of travel in foreign
lands, particularly those which dealt with the scenery,
the people, and the resources of America. The spell which
these exercised over his imagination, joined to a love of
adventure which was inherent in his temperament, and
inherited, perhaps with his race, determined his career.
At the age of twenty he closed his theological tomes, and
girding up his loins with a stout heart he sailed from the
shores of the Old World for the New. Following the
spirit in his feet he landed at New Orleans, which was
probably a more promising field for a young man of his
talents than any Northern city, and was speedily engaged
in business. The nature of this business is not stated,
further than it was that of a trader; but whatever it was
it obliged this young Irishman to make long journeys into
the interior of the country, which was almost a <i>terra incognita</i>.
Sparsely settled, where settled at all, it was still
clothed in primeval verdure—here in the endless reach of
savannas, there in the depth of pathless woods, and far
away to the North and the West in those monotonous
ocean-like levels of land for which the speech of England
has no name—the Prairies. Its population was nomadic,
not to say barbaric, consisting of tribes of Indians whose
hunting grounds from time immemorial the region was;
hunters and trappers, who had turned their backs upon
civilization for the free, wild life of nature; men of
doubtful or dangerous antecedents, who had found it convenient
to leave their country for their country’s good;
and scattered about hardy pioneer communities from Eastern
States, advancing waves of the great sea of emigration
which is still drawing the course of empire westward.
Travelling in a country like this, and among people like
these, Mayne Reid passed five years of his early manhood.
He was at home wherever he went, and never more so
than when among the Indians of the Red River territory,
with whom he spent several months, learning their language,
studying their customs, and enjoying the wild and
beautiful scenery of their camping grounds. Indian for
the time, he lived in their lodges, rode with them, hunted
with them, and night after night sat by their blazing
camp-fires listening to the warlike stories of the braves
and the quaint legends of the medicine men. There was
that in the blood of Mayne Reid which fitted him to lead
this life at this time, and whether he knew it or not it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>educated his genius as no other life could have done. It
familiarized him with a large extent of country in the
South and West; it introduced him to men and manners
which existed nowhere else; and it revealed to him the
secrets of Indian life and character.</p>

<p class='c016'>There was another side, however, to Mayne Reid than
that we have touched upon, and this, at the end of five
years, drew him back to the average life of his kind. We
find him next in Philadelphia, where he began to contribute
stories and sketches of travel to the newspapers
and magazines. Philadelphia was then the most literate
city in the United States, the one in which a clever writer
was at once encouraged and rewarded. Frank and warm-hearted,
he made many friends there among journalists
and authors. One of these friends was Edgar Allan Poe,
whom he often visited at his home in Spring Garden, and
concerning whom years after, when he was dead, he wrote
with loving tenderness.</p>

<p class='c016'>The next episode in the career of Mayne Reid was not
what one would expect from a man of letters, though it
was just what might have been expected from a man of
his temperament and antecedents. It grew out of the
time, which was warlike, and it drove him into the army
with which the United States speedily crushed the forces
of the sister Republic—Mexico. He obtained a commission,
and served throughout the war with great bravery
and distinction. This stormy episode ended with a severe
wound, which he received in storming the heights of Chapultepec—a
terrible battle which practically ended the
war.</p>

<p class='c016'>A second episode of a similar character, but with a more
fortunate conclusion, occurred about four years later. It
grew out of another war, which, happily for us, was not on
our borders, but in the heart of Europe, where the Hungarian
race had risen in insurrection against the hated power
of Austria. Their desperate valor in the face of tremendous
odds excited the sympathy of the American people,
and fired the heart of Captain Mayne Reid, who buckled
on his sword once more, and sailed from New York with
a body of volunteers to aid the Hungarians in their struggles
for independence. They were too late, for hardly had
they reached Paris before they learned that all was over:
Görgey had surrendered at Arad, and Hungary was
crushed. They were at once dismissed, and Captain Reid
betook himself to London.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The life of the Mayne Reid in whom we are most interested—Mayne
Reid, the author—began at this time,
when he was in his thirty-first year, and ended only on
the day of his death, October 21, 1883. It covered one third
of a century, and was, when compared with that
which had preceded it, uneventful, if not devoid of incident.
There is not much that needs be told—not much,
indeed, that can be told—in the life of a man of letters
like Captain Mayne Reid. It is written in his books.
Mayne Reid was one of the best known authors of his
time—differing in this from many authors who are popular
without being known—and in the walk of fiction which
he discovered for himself he is an acknowledged master.
His reputation did not depend upon the admiration
of the millions of young people who read his books, but
upon the judgment of mature critics, to whom his delineations
of adventurous life were literature of no common
order. His reputation as a story-teller was widely recognized
on the Continent, where he was accepted as an
authority in regard to the customs of the pioneers and the
guerilla warfare of the Indian tribes, and was warmly
praised for his freshness, his novelty, and his hardy originality.
The people of France and Germany delighted in
this soldier-writer. “There was not a word in his books
which a school-boy could not safely read aloud to his
mother and sisters.” So says a late English critic, to which
another adds, that if he has somewhat gone out of fashion
of late years, the more’s the pity for the school-boy of the
period. What Defoe is in Robinson Crusoe—realistic idyl
of island solitude—that, in his romantic stories of wilderness
life, is his great scholar, Captain Mayne Reid.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE MAN-EATERS OF THE FEEGEE ISLANDS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>Have I a reader who has not heard of the “King
of the Cannibal Islands?” I think I may take it for
granted that there is not one in my large circle of boy-readers
who has not heard of that royal anthropophagist,
that “mighty king” who,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>“in one hut,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had fifty wives as black as <i>sut</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fifty of a double smut—</div>
      <div class='line in4'>That King of the Cannibal Islands.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>And yet, strange as it may appear, the old song was
no exaggeration—neither as regards the number of his
wives, nor any other particular relating to King “Musty-fusty-shang.”
On the contrary, it presents a picture of
the life and habits of his polygamous majesty that is,
alas! too ludicrously like the truth.</p>

<p class='c016'>Though the king of the Cannibal Islands has been
long known by reputation, people never had any very
definite idea in what quarter of the world his majesty’s
dominions lay. Being, as the name implies, an island-kingdom,
it was to be looked for of course, in some part
of the ocean; and the Pacific Ocean or Great South
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Sea was generally regarded as that in which it was
situated; but whether it was the Tonga Islands, or the
Marquesas, or the Loo-Choos, or the Soo-loos—or some
other group, that was entitled to the distinction of being
the man-eating community, with the man-eating king at
their head—was not very distinctly ascertained up to
a recent period. On this head there is uncertainty no
longer. Though in several groups of South-Sea Islands
the horrible propensity is known to exist, yet the man-eaters,
<i>par excellence</i>, the real <i>bona-fide</i> followers of the
habit, are the <i>Feegees</i>. Beyond doubt these are the
greatest cannibals in all creation, their islands the true
“Cannibal Islands,” and their king no other than “Musty-fusty-shang”
himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>Alas! the subject is too serious to jest upon, and it is
not without pain that we employ our pen upon it. The
truth must needs be told; and there is no reason why
the world should not know how desperately wicked men
may become under the influence of a despotism that
leaves the masses in the power of the irresponsible few,
with no law, either moral or physical, to restrain their
unbridled passions.</p>

<p class='c016'>You will find the Feegee Islands, in the Pacific
Ocean, in the latitude of 18° south. This parallel
passes nearly through the centre of the group. Their
longitude is remarkable: it is the complement of the
meridian of Greenwich—the line 180°. Therefore,
when it is noon in London, it is midnight among the
Feegees. Take the intersection of these two lines, 18°
latitude and 180° longitude as a centre; describe an
imaginary circle, with a diameter of 300 miles; its circumference,
with the slight exception of a small outlying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>group, will enclose, in a “ring fence,” as it were, the
whole Feegee archipelago.</p>

<p class='c016'>The group numbers, in all, no fewer than 225 islands
and islets, of which between 80 and 90 are at present
inhabited—the whole population being not much under
200,000. The estimates of writers differ widely on this
point; some state 150,000—others, more than double
this amount. There is reason to believe that 150,000
is too low. Say, then, 200,000; since the old adage;
“In medias res,” is generally true.</p>

<p class='c016'>Only two of the islands are large,—“Viti,” and
“Vanua.” Viti is 90 miles long, by 50 in breadth,
and Vanua 100 by 25. Some are what are known as
“coral islands;” others are “volcanic,” presenting all
varieties of mountain aspect, rugged and sublime. A
few of the mountain-peaks attain the elevation of 5,000
feet above sea-level, and every form is known—table-topped,
dome-shaped, needle, and conical. In fact, no
group in the Pacific affords so many varieties of form
and aspect, as are to be observed in the Feegee archipelago.
In sailing through these islands, the most lovely
landscapes open out before the eye, the most picturesque
groupings of rocks, ridges, and mountain-peaks,
ravines filled with luxuriant vegetation, valleys covered
with soft verdure, so divinely fair as to appear the
abode, of angelic beings. “So beautiful was their aspect,”
writes one who visited them, “that I could scarcely
bring my mind to the realizing sense of the well-known
fact, that they were the abode of a savage,
ferocious, and treacherous race of cannibals.” Such,
alas! is the fact, well known, as the writer observes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps to no part of the world has Nature been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>more bountiful than to the Feegee Islands. She has
here poured out her favors in very profusion; and the
<i>cornucopiæ</i> might be regarded as an emblem of the
land. The richest products of a tropic vegetation flourish
in an abundance elsewhere unknown, and the
growth of valuable articles of food is almost spontaneous.
Many kinds are really of spontaneous production;
and those under cultivation are almost endless
in numbers and variety. Yams grow to the length
of six feet, weighing one hundred pounds each! and
several varieties are cultivated. The sweet potato
reaches the weight of five or six pounds, and the
“taro” (<i>Arum esculentum</i>) also produces a root of
enormous size, which forms the staple article of the
Feegeean’s food. Still another great tuber, weighing
twenty or thirty pounds, and used as a liquorice, is the
produce of the “massawe,” or ti-tree (<i>dracæna terminalis</i>);
and the root of the <i>piper methisticum</i> often attains
the weight of one hundred and forty pounds!
This last is possessed of highly narcotic properties;
and is the material universally used in the distillation,
or rather brewing, of the native drink called “yaqona”—the
“kava” of the South-Sea voyagers. Bread-fruit
grows in abundance: there being no less than nine varieties
of this celebrated tree upon the different islands
of the group, each producing a distinct kind of fruit;
and what is equally remarkable, of the <i>musaceæ</i>—the
plantain and banana—there are in the Feegee isles
thirty different kinds, either of spontaneous growth, or
cultivated! All these are well distinguished from one
another, and bear distinct appellations. Three kinds
of cocoa-palm add to the extraordinary variety of vegetable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>food, as well as to the picturesqueness of the
scenery; but there is no lack of lovely forms in the
vegetation, where the beautiful ti-tree grows,—where
the fern and the screw-pines flourish,—where plantains
and bananas unfold their broad bright leaves to
the sun; where <i>arums</i> spread their huge fronds mingling
with the thick succulent blades of the bromelia,
and where pawpaws, shaddocks, orange and lime-trees
exhibit every hue of foliage, from deep green to the
most brilliant golden.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fruits of a hundred species are grown in the greatest
plenty; the orange and the Papuan apple, the shaddock
and lemon; in short, almost every species of fruit that
will flourish in a tropical clime. In addition, many indigenous
and valuable kinds, both of roots and fruits, are
peculiar to the Feegee group, yet unknown and uncultivated
in any other part of the world. Even the very
cloth of the country—and a beautiful fabric it makes—is
the product of an indigenous tree, the “malo” or
paper-mulberry (<i>Brousonetia papyrifera</i>), the “tapa”
of voyagers. Not only the material for dresses, but the
tapestry for the adornment of their temples, the curtains
and hangings of their houses, are all obtained from this
valuable tree.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have not space for a more detailed account of the
productions of these isles. It would fill a volume to
describe with any degree of minuteness the various
genera and species of its plants alone. Enough has
been said to show how bountiful, or rather how prodigal,
nature has been to the islands of the Feegeean
Archipelago.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of the animal kingdom there is not much to be said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Of quadrupeds there is the usual paucity of species that
is noticed everywhere throughout the Polynesian islands.
Dogs and pigs are kept; the latter in considerable numbers,
as the flesh forms an important article of food; but
they are not indigenous to the Feegee group, though the
period of their introduction is unknown. Two or three
small rodents are the only quadrupeds yet known to be
true natives of the soil. Reptiles are alike scarce in
species,—though the turtle is common upon the coasts,
and its fishery forms the regular occupation of a particular
class of the inhabitants. The species of birds
are more numerous, and there are parrots, peculiar to
the islands, of rich and beautiful plumage.</p>

<p class='c016'>But we are not allowed to dwell upon these subjects.
Interesting as may be the zoölogy and botany of the
Feegeean Archipelago, both sink into insignificance
when brought into comparison with its ethnology,—the
natural history of its human inhabitants;—a subject
of deep, but alas! of a terribly painful interest. By
inquiry into the condition and character of these people,
we shall see how little they have deserved the favors
which nature has so bounteously bestowed upon them.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the portrait of the Feegeean you will expect something
frightfully hideous,—knowing, as you already do,
that he is an eater of human flesh,—a man of gigantic
stature, swarthy skin, bloodshot eyes, gaunt, bony jaws,
and terrific aspect. You will expect this man to be
described as being naked,—or only with the skin of a
wild beast upon his shoulders,—building no house,
manufacturing no household or other utensils, and armed
with a huge knotted club, which he is ever ready to use:—a
man who dwells in a cavern, sleeps indifferently in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the open air or under the shelter of a bush; in short, a
true savage. That is the sort of creature you expect me
to describe, and I confess that just such a physical aspect—just
such a condition of personal hideousness—would
be exactly in keeping with the moral deformity of the
Feegeean. You would furthermore expect this savage
to be almost devoid of intellectual power,—altogether
wanting in moral sense,—without knowledge of right
and wrong,—without knowledge of any kind,—without
ideas. It seems but natural you should look for
such characteristics in a <i>cannibal</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The portrait I am about to paint will disappoint you.
I do not regret it, since it enables me to bring forward
another testimony that man in his original nature is not
a being of such desperate wickedness. That simple and
primitive state, which men glibly call <i>savage</i>, is <i>not</i> the
condition favorable to cannibalism. I know that it is to
such people that the habit is usually ascribed, but quite
erroneously. The Andaman islander has been blamed
with it simply because he chances to go naked, and
looks, as he is, hungry and emaciated. The charge is
proved false. The Bushman of South Africa has enjoyed
a similar reputation. It also turns out to be a
libel. The Carib long lived under the imputation, simply
because he presented a fierce front to the Spanish
tyrant, who would have enslaved him; and we have
heard the same stigma cast upon a dozen other tribes,
the <i>lowest savages</i> being usually selected; in other
words, those whose condition appeared the most wretched.
In such cases the accusation has ever been found,
upon investigation, to be erroneous.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the most primitive state in which man appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>upon the earth, he is either without social organization
altogether, or if any do exist, it is either patriarchal or
republican. Neither of these conditions is favorable to
the development of vice,—much less the most horrible
of all vices.</p>

<p class='c016'>It will not do to quote the character of the Bushman,
or certain other of the low tribes, to refute this statement.
These are not men in their primitive state
ascending upward, but a condition altogether the reverse.
They are the decaying remnants of some corrupt civilization,
sinking back into the dust out of which they were
created.</p>

<p class='c016'>No—and I am happy to say it—man, as he originally
came from the hands of the Creator, has no such
horrid propensity as cannibalism. In his primitive state
he has never been known to practise it,—except when
the motives have been such as have equally tempted
men professing the highest civilization,—but this cannot
be considered cannibalism. Where that exists in its
true unmitigated form,—and unhappily it does so,—the
early stages of social organization must have been
passed; the republican and patriarchal forms must both
have given place to the absolute and monarchical. This
condition of things is absolutely necessary, before man
can obtain sufficient power to prey upon his fellow-man
to the extent of eating him. There can be no “cannibal”
without a “king.”</p>

<p class='c016'>So far from the Feegeean cannibals being <i>savages</i>, according
to the ordinary acceptation of the term, they are
in reality the very reverse. If we adhere to the usual
meaning of the word civilization, understanding by it a
people possessing an intelligent knowledge of arts, living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>in well-built houses, fabricating fine goods, tilling their
lands in a scientific and successful manner, practising the
little politenesses and accomplishments of social life,—if
these be the <i>criteria</i> of civilization, then it is no more
than the truth to say that the standard possessed by the
Feegee islanders is incomparably above that of the lower
orders of most European nations.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is startling to reflect—startling as sad—that a
people possessed of such intellectual power, and who
have ever exercised it to a wonderful extent, in arts,
manufactures, and even in the accomplishing of their
own persons, should at the same time exhibit moral traits
of such an opposite character. An atrocious cruelty,—an
instinct for oppression, brutal and ferocious,—a heart
pitiless as that of the fiend himself,—a hand ever ready
to strike the murderous blow, even though the victim be
a brother,—lips that lie in every word they speak,—a
tongue ever bent on barbaric boasting,—a bosom that
beats only with sentiments of treachery and abject cowardice,—these
are the revolting characteristics of the
Feegeean. Dark as is his skin, his soul is many shades
darker.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is time, however, to descend to a more particular
delineation of this man-eating monster; and first, we
shall give a description of his personal appearance.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Feegeeans are above the average height of Europeans
or white men: men of six feet are common
among them, though few reach the height of six feet six.
Corpulent persons are not common, though large and
muscular men abound. Their figure corresponds more
nearly to that of the white man than any other race
known. The proportions of their limbs resemble those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of northern Europeans, though some are narrower across
the loins. Their chests are broad and sinewy, and their
stout limbs and short, well-set necks are conspicuous
characters. The outline of the face is a good oval; the
mouth large, with white teeth regularly arranged—ah!
those horrid teeth!—the nose is well shaped, with full
nostrils; yet quite distinct, as are the lips also, from the
type of the African negro. Indeed, with the exception
of their color, they bear very little resemblance to the
negro,—that is, the thick-lipped, flat-nosed negro of our
fancy; for there are negro tribes in Africa whose features
are as fine as those of the Feegeeans, or even as
our own. In color of skin the Feegeean is nearly, if not
quite, as dark as the negro; but it may be remarked that
there are different shades, as there are also among pure
Ethiopians. In the Feegee group there are many men
of mulatto color, but these are not of the original Feegee
stock. They are either a mixed offspring with the
Tonga islander, or pure-bred Tonga islanders themselves
who for the past two hundred years have been insinuating
themselves into the social compact of the Feegeeans.
These light-colored people are mostly found on the
eastern or windward side of the Feegee group,—that is,
the side towards Tonga itself,—and the trade-winds will
account for their immigration, which was at first purely
accidental. They at present play a conspicuous part in
the affairs of the Feegeeans, being in favor with the
kings and great chiefs, partly on account of their being
better sailors than the native Feegeeans, and partly on
account of other services which these tyrants require them
to perform. In some arts the Tongans are superior to
the Feegeeans, but not in all. In pottery, wood-carving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>making of mats or baskets, and the manufacture of the
tapa cloth, the Feegeeans stand unrivalled over all the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class='c016'>We need say no more of the Tongans here; they are
elsewhere described. Those dwelling in Feegee are
not all fixed there for life. Some are so, and these are
called Tonga-Feegeeans; the others are only visitors,
giving their services temporarily to the Feegeean chiefs,
or occupied in ship-building,—in constructing those
great war canoes that have been the astonishment of
South-Sea voyagers, and which Feegee sends forth from
her dock-yards in the greatest perfection. These, when
finished by the Tongan strangers, are used to carry
them back to their own islands, that lie about three
hundred miles to the windward (southeast).</p>

<p class='c016'>But to continue the portrait of the Feegeean. We
have touched almost every part of it except the hair;
but this requires a most elaborate limning, such as the
owner himself gives it. In its natural state the head
of the Feegeean is covered by a mass of black hair
long, frizzled, and bushy, sometimes encroaching on the
forehead, and joined by whiskers to a thick, round, or
pointed beard, to which mustaches are often added.
Black is, of course, the natural color of the hair, but
it is not always worn of this hue. Other colors are
thought more becoming; and the hair, both of the men
and women, is dyed in a variety of ways, lime burning
it to a redish or whity-brown shade. A turmeric-yellow,
or even a vermilion-red are not uncommon colors;
but all these keep varying, according to the change of
fashions at court!</p>

<p class='c016'>Commodore Wilkes, who has given a good deal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>his time to an exploration of the Feegee Islands, states
that the Feegee hair, in its natural condition, is straight,
and not “frizzled,” as described above—he says that
the frizzling is the work of the barber; but the Commodore
is altogether mistaken in this idea. Thousands
of Feegeans, whose hair was never touched by a barber,
nor dressed even by themselves, exhibit this peculiarity.
We regret to add that this is only one of a
thousand erroneous statements which the Commodore
has made during his gigantic exploration. He may
have been excellent at his own speciality of making
soundings and laying down charts; but on all matters
pertaining to natural history or ethnology, the worthy
Commodore appears to have been purblind, and, indeed,
his extensive staff of naturalists of every kind have
produced far less than might have been expected from
such excellent opportunities as they enjoyed. The observations
of the Commodore will not stand the test of
time, and cannot be depended upon as safe guides, excepting
in those cases where he was an actual eyewitness.
About his truthful intentions there can be no
doubt whatever.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of one very peculiar performance among the Feegees
he appears to have had actual demonstration,
and as he has described this with sufficient minuteness,
we shall copy his account; though, after what
we have said, we should apologize largely for the liberty.
The performance referred to is that of “barberizing”
a barbarian monarch, and may be taken as a
proof of high civilization among the Feegees. It will
be seen that, with the exception of the tabooed fingers,
there is not much difference between a barber of Bond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Street and an artist of like calling in the Cannibal
Islands.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The chiefs in particular,” writes Commodore Wilkes,
“pay great attention to the dressing of their heads, and
for this purpose all of them have barbers, whose sole
occupation is the care of their masters’ heads. These
barbers are called <i>a-vu-ni-ulu</i>. They are attached to
the household of the chiefs in numbers of from two to
a dozen. The duty is held to be of so sacred a nature,
that their hands are tabooed from all other employment,
and they are not even permitted to feed themselves.
To dress the head of a chief requires several hours.
The hair is made to spread out from the head, on
every side, to a distance that is often eight inches.
The beard, which is also carefully nursed, often reaches
the breast, and when a Feegeean has these important
parts of his person well dressed, he exhibits a degree
of conceit that is not a little amusing.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In the process of dressing the hair it is well anointed
with oil, mixed with a carbonaceous black, until it is
completely saturated. The barber then takes the hair-pin,
which is a long and slender rod, made of tortoise-shell
or bone, and proceeds to twitch almost every separate
hair. This causes it to frizzle and stand erect.
The bush of hair is then trimmed smooth by singeing
it, until it has the appearance of an immense wig.
When this has been finished, a piece of tapa, so fine
as to resemble tissue-paper, is wound in light folds
around it, to protect the hair from the dew or dust.
This covering, which has the look of a turban, is called
<i>sala</i>, and none but the chiefs are allowed to wear it;
any attempt to assume this head-dress by a <i>kai-si</i>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>common person, would be immediately punished with
death. The sala, when taken proper care of, will last
three weeks or a month, and the hair is not dressed
except when it is removed; but the high chiefs and
dandies seldom allow a day to pass without changing
the sala and having the hair put in order.”</p>

<p class='c016'>With this account, we conclude our description of
the Feegeean’s person. His costume is of the simplest
kind, and easily described. With the men it is merely
a strip of “tapa” or “malo” cloth passed several times
round the waist, and the ends left to hang down in
front. The length of the hanging ends determines the
rank of the wearer, and only in the case of kings or
great chiefs are they allowed to touch the ground. A
turban of the finest tapa cloth among the great mop of
hair is another badge of rank, worn only by kings and
chiefs; and this head-dress, which adds greatly to the
dignified appearance of the wearer, is not always coiffed
in the same fashion, but each chief adapts it to his own
or the prevailing taste of the court. The dress of the
women is a mere waist-belt, with a fringe from six to
ten inches in length. It is worn longer after they have
become wives, sometimes reaching near the knee, and
forming a very picturesque garment. It is called the
“liku,” and many of them are manufactured with surprising
skill and neatness, the material being obtained
from various climbing plants of the forest. Under the
“liku” the women are tattooed, and there only. Their
men, on the contrary, do not undergo the tattoo; but on
grand occasions paint their faces and bodies in the most
fanciful colors and patterns.</p>

<p class='c016'>The kings and some chiefs suspend from their necks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>shell ornaments—often as large as a dining-plate—that
hang down upon the breast. Some, instead of this,
wear a necklace of whales’ teeth, carved to resemble
claws, and bearing a very close resemblance to the
necklaces of the Prairie Indians, made of the claws
of the grizzly bear. Another kind of necklace—perhaps
more appropriate to the Feegee—is a string of
human teeth; and this kind is not unfrequently worn
by these ferocious dandies.</p>

<p class='c016'>It must not be supposed that the scantiness of the
Feegeean costume arises from poverty or stinginess on
the part of the wearer. Nothing of the kind. It is
simply because such is the fashion of the time. Were
it otherwise, he could easily supply the materials, but
he does not wish it otherwise. His climate is an eternal
summer, and he has no need to encumber his body
with extraneous clothing. With the exception of the
turban upon his head, his king is as naked as himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>You may suppose that the Feegeans have but little
notions of modesty; but, strange as it may appear, this
is in reality not one of their failings. They regard the
“malo” and “liku” as the most modest of garments;
and a man or woman seen in the streets without these
scanty coverings would be in danger of being clubbed
to death!</p>

<p class='c016'>It must be acknowledged that they are not <i>altogether</i>
depraved—for in this respect they present the most
astounding anomaly. Certain virtues are ascribed to
them, and as I have painted only the dark side of their
character, it is but fair to give the other. Indeed, it is
a pleasure to do this—though there is not enough of
the favorable to make any great alteration in the picture.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The whole character is so well described by one
of the most acute observers who has yet visited the
South Seas—the Wesleyan missionary Williams—that
we borrow the description.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The aspect of the Feegeean,” says Mr. Williams,
“with reference to his mental character, so far from
supporting the decision which would thrust him almost
out of mankind, presents many points of great interest,
showing that, if an ordinary amount of attention were
bestowed on him, he would take no mean rank in the
human family, to which, hitherto, he has been a disgrace.
Dull, barren stupidity forms no part of his character.
His feelings are acute, but not lasting; his
emotions easily roused, but transient; he can love truly,
and hate deeply; he can sympathize with thorough
sincerity, and feign with consummate skill; his fidelity
and loyalty are strong and enduring, while his revenge
never dies, but waits to avail itself of circumstances,
or of the blackest treachery, to accomplish its purpose.
His senses are keen, and so well employed, that he
often excels the white man in ordinary things. Tact
has been called ‘ready cash,’ and of this the native of
Feegee has a full share, enabling him to surmount at once
many difficulties, and accomplish many tasks, that would
have ‘fixed’ an Englishman. Tools, cord, or packing
materials, he finds directly, where the white man would
be at a loss for either; and nature seems to him but a
general store for his use, where the article he wants is
always within reach.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In social diplomacy the Feegeean is very cautious
and clever. That he ever paid a visit merely <i>en passant</i>,
is hard to be believed. If no request leaves his lips, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>has brought the desire, and only waits for a good chance
to present it now, or prepare the way for its favorable
reception at some other time. His face and voice are
all pleasantness; and he has the rare skill of finding out
just the subject on which you most like to talk, or sees
at once whether you desire silence. Rarely will he fail
to read your countenance; and the case must be urgent
indeed which obliges him to ask a favor when he sees a
frown. The more important he feels his business the
more earnestly he protests that he has none at all; and
the subject uppermost in his thoughts comes last to his
lips, or is not even named; for he will make a second,
or even a third visit, rather than risk a failure through
precipitancy. He seems to read other men by intuition,
especially where selfishness or lust are prominent traits.
If it serves his purpose, he will study difficult and peculiar
characters, reserving the results for future use;
if afterwards he wish to please them, he will know
how, and if to annoy them, it will be done most exactly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“His sense of hearing is acute, and by a stroke of
his nail he judges the ripeness of fruits, or soundness of
various substances.”</p>

<p class='c016'>From what source the Feegeean has sprung is purely
a matter of conjecture. He has no history,—not even
a tradition of when his ancestors first peopled the Archipelago
in which we now find him. Of his race we have
not a much clearer knowledge. Speculation places him
in the same family as the “Papuan Negro,” and he has
some points of resemblance to this race, in the color and
frizzled hair; but there is as much difference between the
wretched native of West Australia and the finely-developed
Feegeean as there is between the stunted Laplander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and the stalwart Norwegian; nor is the coarse rough
skin of the true Papuan to be recognized in the smooth,
glossy epidermis of the Feegee Islander. This, however,
may be the result of better living; and certainly among
the mountain-tribes of the Feegees, who lead lives of
greater privation and hardship, the approach to the Papuan
appearance is observable. It is hardly necessary
to add that the Feegeean is of a race quite distinct from
that known as the Polynesian or South-Sea Islander.
This last is different not only in form, complexion, and
language, but also in many important mental characteristics.
It is to this race the Tongans belong, and its
pecularities will be sketched in treating of that people.</p>

<p class='c016'>Were we to enter upon a minute description of the
manners and customs of the Fegees,—of their mode
of house and canoe building,—of their arts and manufactures,
for they possess both,—of their implements of
agriculture and domestic use,—of their weapons of war,—their
ceremonies of religion and court etiquette,—our
task would require more space than is here allotted
to us: it would in fact be as much as to describe the
complete social economy of a civilized nation; and a
whole volume would scarce suffice to contain such a description.
In a sketch like the present, the account of
these people requires to be given in the most condensed
and synoptical form, and only those points can be touched
upon that may appear of the greatest interest.</p>

<p class='c016'>It must be remembered that the civilization of the
Feegees—of course, I allude to their proficiency in
the industrial arts—is entirely an indigenous growth.
They have borrowed ideas from the Tongans,—as the
Tongans have also from them,—but both are native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>productions of the South Sea, and not derived from any
of the so-called great <i>centres</i> of civilization. Such as
have sprung from these sources are of modern date, and
make but a small feature in the panorama of Feegeean
life. The houses they build are substantial, and suitable
to their necessities. We cannot stay to note the architecture
minutely. The private dwellings are usually
about twenty-five feet long by fifteen in breadth, the
interior forming one room, but with a sort of elevated
divan at the end, sometimes screened with beautiful
“tapa” curtains, and serving as the dormitory.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ground-plan of the house is that of an oblong
square,—or, to speak more properly, a parallelogram.
The walls are constructed of timber,—being straight
posts of cocoa-palm, tree-fern, bamboo, or bread-fruit,—the
spaces between closely warped or otherwise filled in
with reeds of cane or <i>calamus</i>. The thatch is of the
leaves of the wild or cultivated sugar-cane,—sometimes
of a <i>pandanus</i>,—thickly laid on, especially near the
eaves, where it is carefully cropped, exposing an edge of
from one to two feet in thickness. The roof has four
faces,—that is, it is a “hip roof.” It is made with a
very steep pitch, and comes down low, projecting far
over the heads of the upright timbers. This gives a sort
of shaded veranda all around the house, and throws the
rain quite clear of the walls. The ridge-pole is a peculiar
feature; it is fastened to the ridge of the thatch by
strong twisted ropes, that give it an ornamental appearance;
and its carved ends project at both gables, or
rather, over the “hip roofs,” to the length of a foot, or
more; it is further ornamented by white shells, these of
the <i>cyprea ovula</i> being most used for the purpose. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Feegee house presents altogether a picturesque and not
inelegant appearance. The worst feature is the low door.
There are usually two of them, neither in each house
being over three feet in height. The Feegee assigns no
reason why his door is made so low; but as he is frequently
in expectation of a visitor, with a murderous
bludgeon in his grasp, it is possible this may have something
to do with his making the entrance so difficult.</p>

<p class='c016'>The houses of the chiefs, and the great council-house,
or temple,—called the “Bure,”—are built precisely in
the same style; only that both are larger, and the doors,
walls, and ridge-poles more elaborately ornamented.
The fashionable style of decoration is a plaiting of cocoa
fibre, or “sinnet,” which is worked and woven around
the posts in regular figures of “relievo.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The house described is not universal throughout all
the group. There are many “orders” of architecture,
and that prevailing in the Windward Islands is different
from the style of the Leeward, and altogether of a better
kind. Different districts have different forms. In one
you may see a village looking like an assemblage of
wicker baskets, while in another you might fancy it a
collection of rustic arbors. A third seems a collection
oblong hayricks, with holes in their sides; while, in a
fourth these ricks are conical.</p>

<p class='c016'>It will be seen that, with this variety in house-building,
it would be a tedious task to illustrate the
complete architecture of Feegeeans. Even Master
Ruskin himself would surrender it up in despair.</p>

<p class='c016'>Equally tedious would it be to describe the various
implements or utensils which a Feegee house contains.
The furniture is simple enough. There are neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>chairs, tables, nor bedsteads. The bed is a beautiful
mat spread on the däis, or divan; and in the houses of
the rich the floors are covered with a similar carpet.
These mats are of the finest texture, far superior to
those made elsewhere. The materials used are the
<i>Hibiscus tiliaceus</i>, <i>Pandanus odoratissimus</i>, and a species
of rush. They are in great abundance in every
house,—even the poorest person having his mat to sit
or lie upon; and it is they that serve for the broad-spreading
sails of the gigantic canoes. In addition to
the mats, plenty of tapa cloth may be seen, and baskets
of every shape and size,—the wicker being obtained
from the rattan (<i>flagellaria</i>), and other sources. One
piece of furniture deserves especial mention,—this is
the pillow upon which the Feegee lord lays his head
when he goes to sleep. It presents but little claim to
the appellation of a <i>downy</i> pillow; since it is a mere
cylinder of hard polished wood, with short arched pedestals
to it, to keep it firmly in its place. Its object is to
keep the great frizzled mop from being tossed or disarranged,
during the hours of repose; and Feegeean
vanity enables the owner of the mop to endure this
flinty bolster with the most uncomplaining equanimity.
If he were possessed of the slightest spark of conscience,
even this would be soft, compared with any pillow upon
which he might rest his guilty head.</p>

<p class='c016'>In addition to the baskets, other vessels meet the eye.
These are of pottery, as varied in shape and size as
they are in kind. There are pots and pans, bowls,
dishes, cups and saucers, jars and bottles,—many of
them of rare and curious designs,—some red, some
ornamented with a glaze obtained from the gum of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span><i>kauri</i> pine,—for this tree is also an indigenous production
of the Feegee Islands. Though no potter’s wheel
is known to the Feegees, the proportions of their vessels
are as just and true, and their polish as complete, as if
Stafford had produced them. There are cooking pots to
be seen of immense size. These are jars formed with
mouths wide enough to admit the largest joint. I dare
not mention the kind of joint that is frequently cooked
in those great caldrons. Ugh! the horrid pots!</p>

<p class='c016'>Their implements are equally varied and numerous,—some
for manufacturing purposes, and others for
agriculture. The latter are of the simplest kind. The
Feegee plough is merely a pointed stick inserted deeply
into the ground, and kept moving about till a lump of
the soil is broken upward. This is crushed into mould,
first by a light club, and afterwards pulverized with the
fingers. The process is slow, but fast enough for the
Feegeean, whose farm is only a garden. He requires
no plough, neither bullocks nor horses. With taro-roots
and sweet potatoes that weigh ten pounds each, yams
and yaqonas over one hundred, and plantains producing
bunches of a hundred and fifty fruits to the single head,
why need he trouble himself by breaking up more surface?
His single acre yields him as much vegetable
wealth as fifty would to an English farmer!</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not to be supposed that he has it all to himself;
no, nor half of it either; nor yet the fifth part of it.
At least four fifths of his sweat has to be expended in
tax or tithe; and this brings us to the form of his government.
We shall not dwell long upon this subject.
Suffice it to say that the great body of the people are
in a condition of abject serfdom,—worse than slavery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>itself. They own nothing that they can call their own,—not
their wives,—not their daughters,—not even
their lives! All these may be taken from them at any
hour. There is no law against despoiling them,—no
check upon the will and pleasure of their chiefs or
superiors; and, as these constitute a numerous body, the
poor <i>canaille</i> have no end of ruffian despoilers. It is an
every-day act for a chief to rob, or <i>club to death</i>, one of
the common people! and no unfrequent occurrence to be
himself clubbed to death by his superior, the king! Of
these <i>kings</i> there are eight in Feegee,—not one, as the
old song has it; but the words of the ballad will apply
to each of them with sufficient appropriateness. Any
one of them will answer to the character of “Musty-fusty-shang!”</p>

<p class='c016'>These kings have their residences on various islands,
and the different parts of the group are distributed somewhat
irregularly under their rule. Some islands, or
parts of islands, are only tributary to them; others connected
by a sort of deferential alliance; and there are
communities quite independent, and living under the
arbitrary sway of their own chieftains. The kings are
not all of equal power or importance; but in this respect
there have been many changes, even during the Feegeean
historical period,—which extends back only to
the beginning of the present century. Sometimes one
is the most influential, sometimes another; and in most
cases the pre-eminence is obtained by him who possesses
the greatest amount of truculence and treachery. He
who is most successful in murdering his rivals, and ridding
himself of opposition, by the simple application of
the club, usually succeeds in becoming for the time head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“king of the Cannibal Islands.” I do not mean that he
reigns over the whole Archipelago. No king has yet
succeeded in uniting all the islands under one government.
He only gets so far as to be feared everywhere,
and to have tributary presents, and all manner of debasing
compliments offered to him. These kings have all
their courts and court etiquette, just as their “royal
brothers” elsewhere; and the ceremonials observed are
quite as complicated and degrading to the dignity of
man.</p>

<p class='c016'>The punishment for neglecting their observance is
rather more severe in Feegee than elsewhere. For a
decided or wilful non-compliance, the skull of the delinquent
is frequently crushed in by the club of his
majesty himself,—even in presence of a full “drawing-room.”
Lesser or accidental mistakes, or even the exhibition
of an ungraceful <i>gaucherie</i>, are punished by the
loss of a finger: the consequence of which is, that in
Feegee there are many fingers missing! Indeed, a complete
set is rather the exception than the rule. If a king
or great chief should chance to miss his foot and slip
down, it is the true <i>ton</i> for all those who are near or
around him to fall likewise,—the crowd coming down,
literally like a “thousand of bricks!”</p>

<p class='c016'>I might detail a thousand customs to show how far
the dignity of the human form is debased and disgraced
upon Feegee soil; but the subject could be well illustrated
nearer home. Flunkeyism is a fashion unfortunately
not confined to the Feegeean archipelago; and
though the forms in which it exhibits itself there may be
different, the sentiment is still the same. It must ever
appear where men are politically unequal,—wherever
there is a class possessed of hereditary privileges.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>I come to the last,—the darkest feature in the Feegeean
character,—the horrid crime and custom of cannibalism.
I could paint a picture, and fill up the details
with the testimony of scores of eyewitnesses,—a picture
that would cause your heart to weep. It is too
horrid to be given here. My pen declines the office;
and, therefore, I must leave the painful story untold.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h2 class='c013'>MUNDRUCUS, OR BEHEADERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In our general sketch of the Amazonian Indians it
was stated that there were some few tribes who differed
in certain customs from all the rest, and who might even
be regarded as <i>odd among the odd</i>. One of these tribes
is the <i>Mundrucu</i>, which, from its numbers and warlike
strength, almost deserves to be styled a nation. It is,
at all events, a powerful confederacy, of different tribes,
linked together in one common nationality, and including
in their league other Indians which the Mundrucus
themselves first conquered, and afterwards associated
with themselves on terms of equality; in other words,
“annexed” them. The same sort of annexation or alliance
is common among the tribes of North America; as
in the case of the powerful Comanche nation, who extend
their protecting alliance over the Wacoes, Washites, and
Cayguäas or Kioways.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Mahüe</i> is the principal tribe that is patronized
in this fashion by the Mundrucus, and the two together
number at least 20,000 souls.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before the days of the Portuguese slave-hunting, the
Mundrucus occupied the south bank of the Amazon, from
the mouth of the Tapajos to that of the Madeira. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>infamous traffic had the effect of clearing the banks of
the great river of its native inhabitants,—except such
of them as chose to submit to slavery, or become <i>neophytes</i>,
by adopting the monkish faith. Neither of these
courses appeared pleasing in the eyes of the Mundrucus,
and they adopted the only alternative that was likely to
insure their independence,—by withdrawing from the
dangerous proximity of the sanguinary slave-trade.</p>

<p class='c016'>This retreat of the Mundrucus, however, was by no
means an ignominious flight. The withdrawal was voluntary
on their part, and not compulsory, as was the
case with weaker tribes. From the earliest times they
had presented a firm front to the Portuguese encroachments,
and the latter were even forced into a sort of
nefarious alliance with them. The leaving the Amazon
on the part of the Mundrucus was rather the result of a
negotiation, by which they conceded their territory—between
the mouths of the Tapajos and Madeira—to
the Brazilian government; and to this hour they are not
exactly unfriendly to Brazilian <i>whites</i>, though to the
mulattoes and negroes, who constitute a large proportion
of the Brazilian population, the Mundrucu knows no
other feeling than that of a deadly hostility. The origin
of their hatred of the Brazilian blacks is to be found in
a revolt which occurred in the provinces of the Lower
Amazon (at Para) in 1835. It was a <i>caste</i> revolution
against whites, but more especially against <i>European</i>
Portuguese. In this affair the Mundrucus were employed
against the darker-skinned rebels—the <i>Cabanos</i>,
as they were called—and did great service in putting
down the rebellion. Hence they retain a lingering
spark of friendship for their <i>ci-devant</i> white allies; or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>perhaps it would be more correct to say they do not
actually hate them, but carry on a little commerce with
their traders. For all that, they occasionally cut the
throats of a few of the latter,—especially those who
do not come to deal directly with them, but who pass
through their country in going from the Amazon to the
diamond mines of Brazil. These last are called <i>Monçaos</i>,
and their business is to carry supplies from the
towns on the Amazon (Santarem and Para) to the miners
of gold and washers of diamonds in the district of
Matto Grosso, of which Cuiaba is the capital. Their
route is by water and “portage” up the Tapajos river,
and through the territory of the dreaded Mundrucus,—requiring
a journey of six months, as perilous and toilsome
as it is tedious.</p>

<p class='c016'>The present residence of the Mundrucus is between
the Tapajos and Madeira, as formerly, but far up on
both rivers. On the Tapajos, above what are known
as the “Caxoeiras,” or Cataracts, their villages are
found. There they dwell, free from all molestation on
the part of the whites; their borders extending widely
around them, and limited only by contact with those
of other warlike tribes like themselves, who are their
deadly enemies. Among these last are the <i>Muras</i>, who
dwell at the mouths of the Madeira and Rio Negro.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Mundrucus build the <i>malocca</i>, elsewhere described;
only in their case it is not used as a dwelling,
but rather as a grand arsenal, a council-chamber, a ball-room,
and, if need be, a fortress. When fearing an
attack, all sleep in it “under arms.” It is a structure
of large size and great strength, usually rendered more
unassailable by being “chinked” and plastered with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>clay. It is in this building that are deposited those horrid
trophies which have given to the Mundrucus their
terrible title of <i>decapitadores</i>, or “beheaders.” The
title and its origin shall be presently explained.</p>

<p class='c016'>Around the great malocca the huts are placed, forming
a village, and in these the people ordinarily dwell.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Mundrucus are not without ample means of subsistence.
Like most other Amazonian tribes, they cultivate
a little manioc, plantains, and even maize; and
they know how to prepare the <i>farinha</i> meal, and,
unfortunately, also the detestable <i>chicha</i>, the universal
beverage of the South-American aborigines. They have
their vessels of calabash—both of the vegetable and
arborescent kinds—and a full set of implements and
utensils for the field and kitchen. Their war weapons
are those common to other Amazonian tribes, and they
sometimes also carry the spear. They have canoes of
hollow trees; and, of course, fishing and hunting are the
employments of the men,—the women, as almost everywhere
else among Indians, doing the drudgery,—the
tilling and reaping, the “hewing of wood and the drawing
of water,” the making the household utensils and
using them,—all such offices being beneath the dignity
of the “lordly,” or rather <i>lazy</i> savage.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have said that they carry on a commercial intercourse
with the white traders. It is not of much magnitude,
and their exports consist altogether of the native and
spontaneous productions of the soil, sarsaparilla being
one of the chief articles. They gather this (the women
and children do) during six months of the year. The
other six months no industry is followed,—as this
period is spent in hostile excursions against the neighboring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>tribes. Their imports consist of iron tools and
pieces for weapons; but they more especially barter the
product of their labor for ornamental gewgaws,—such
as savages universally admire and desire. Their sarsaparilla
is good, and much sought for in the medical
market.</p>

<p class='c016'>Every one is acquainted with the nature and character
of this valuable medicinal root, the appearance of
which must also be known to almost everybody,—since
it is so very common for our druggists to display the
bundles of it in their shop windows. Perhaps every one
is not acquainted with the fact, that the sarsaparilla root
is the product of a great many different species of plants
most of them of the genus <i>Simlax</i>, but not a few belonging
to plants of other genera, as those of <i>Carex</i> and <i>Herreria</i>
the roots of which are also sold as sarsaparilla.
The species of simlax are widely distributed throughout
the whole torrid zone, in Asia, Africa, and America, and
some kinds are found growing many degrees outside the
tropics,—as is the case in Virginia and the valley of
the Mississippi, and also on the other side of the Pacific
on the great continent-island of Australia.</p>

<p class='c016'>The best sarsaparilla, however, is that which is produced
in tropical countries, and especially in moist situations,
where the atmosphere is at once hot and humid.
It requires these conditions to concentrate the virtue of
its sap, and render it more active.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would be idle to give a list of the different species
of simlax that furnish the sarsaparilla root of the pharmacopeia.
There is an almost endless number of them,
and they are equally varied in respect to excellence of
quality; some kinds are in reality almost worthless, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>for this reason, in using it as a medicine, great care
should be taken in the selection of the species. Like
all other articles, either of food or medicine, the valuable
kinds are the scarcest; the reason in this case
being that the best sarsaparilla is found in situations
not only difficult of access, but where the gathering of
its root is attended with considerable danger, from the
unhealthy nature of the climate and the hostility of the
savages in whose territory it grows. As to the quantity
that may be obtained, there is no limit, on the
score of any scarcity of the plant itself, since it is
found throughout all the countries of tropical America
plenteously distributed both in species and individual
plants. Such quantities of it grow along the banks of
some South-American rivers, that the Indians have a
belief that those streams known as <i>black waters</i>—such
as the Rio Negro and others—derive their peculiar
color from the roots of this plant. This, however, is
an erroneous supposition, as there are many of the
<i>white-water</i> rivers that run through regions abundantly
supplied with the sarsaparilla root. The black water,
therefore, must arise from some other cause, as yet unknown.</p>

<p class='c016'>As observed, the sarsaparilla of the Mundrucu country
is of the very best quality. It is the <i>Simlax papyracea</i>
of Soiret, and is known in commerce as the
“Lisbon,” or “Brazilian.” It is a climbing plant, or
under-shrub, the stem of which is flattened and angular,
with rows of prickles standing along the prominent
edges. Its leaves are of an oval acuminated shape,
and marked with longitudinal nerves. It shoots up
without any support, to a height of fifteen or twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>feet, after which it embraces the surrounding branches
of trees and spreads to a great distance in every direction.
The main root sends out many long tendrils, all
of like thickness, covered with a brownish bark, of
sometimes of a dark-gray color. These tendrils are
fibrous, and about as thick as a quill. They present
a constant tendency to become crooked, and they are
also wrinkled longitudinally, with here and there some
smaller lateral fibres branching off from the sides.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is in the bark or epidermis of the rhizomes that
the medicinal virtue lies; but the tendrils—both rhizome
and bark—are collected together, and no attempt
is made to separate them, until they have reached
their commercial destination. Indeed, even these are
sold together, the mode of preparing the root being
left to the choice of the consumer, or the apothecary
who procures it.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Mundrucus collect it during the six months of
the rainy season, partly because during the remaining
six they are otherwise employed, and partly for the
reason that, in the time of rain, the roots are more
easily extracted from the damp soil. The process simply
consists in digging them up or dragging them out
of the earth—the latter mode especially where the
tendrils lie near the surface, and they will pull up
without breaking. If the main root be not dug out, it
will send forth new tendrils, which in a short time
would yield a new crop; but the improvident savages
make no prudential calculations of this kind—present
convenience forming their sole consideration; and on
this account both the root and plant are generally destroyed
by them during the operation of collecting.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>As already stated, this labor devolves upon the
women, who are also assisted in it by their children.
They proceed into the depths of the forest—where
the simlax grows in greatest abundance—and after
collecting as much root as they can carry home with
them, they return with their bundles to the malocca.
When fresh gathered the sarsaparilla is heavy enough—partly
on account of the sap which it then contains,
and partly from the quantity of the mud or earth that
adheres to the corrugated surface of the roots.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is extremely probable that in this fresh state the
virtue of the sarsaparilla, as a blood-purifier, is much
greater than after it has passed through the channels
of commerce; and the writer of this sketch has some
reason, derived from personal experience, to believe
that such is the case. Certain it is, that the reputation
of this invaluable drug is far less in countries
where the plant does not grow, than in those where
it is common and can be obtained in its fresh state.
In all parts of Spanish America its virtues are unquestioned,
and experience has led to a more extensive
use of it there than elsewhere. It is probable, therefore,
that the virtue exists in the juice rather than
the cortical integument of the rhizome; and this of
course would be materially altered and deteriorated, if
not altogether destroyed, in the process of exsiccation,
which must necessarily take place in the time required
for transporting it to distant parts of the world. In the
European pharmacopeia it is the epidermis of the root
which is supposed to contain the sanitary principle; and
this, which is of a mucilaginous nature and slightly bitter
taste, is employed, both in decoctions and infusions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>as a tonic and alterative. In America, however, it is
generally taken for what is termed <i>purifying the blood</i>—for
the same purpose as the rhizomes of the <i>Laurus
sassafras</i> and other plants are used; but the sarsaparilla
is generally considered the best, and it certainly <i>is</i> the
best of all known medicines for this purpose. Why it
has fallen in the estimation of the Old-World practitioners,
or why it never obtained so great a reputation as
it has in America, may arise from two circumstances.
First, that the root offered for sale is generally the product
of the less valuable species; and second, that the
sap, and not the rhizome, may be the part that contains
the virtuous principle.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the collected roots have been kept for awhile
they become dry and light, and for the convenience of
stowage and carriage—an important consideration to
the trader in his eight-ton <i>garratea</i>—it is necessary
to have the roots done up in packages of a uniform
length and thickness. These packages are formed by
laying the roots side by side, and doubling in the ends
of the longer ones. A bundle of the proper size for
stowage contains an <i>arroba</i> of twenty-five pounds, though
the weight varies according to the condition of the root.
Uniformity in size is the chief object aimed at, and the
bundles are made of a round or cylindrical shape, about
five inches in diameter, and something more than a yard
in length. They are trimmed off small at the ends—so
as to admit of stowage without leaving any empty
space between two tiers of them—and each bundle is
tightly corded round from one end to the other with a
“sipo,” or creeping plant.</p>

<p class='c016'>It has been stated that this “sipo” is a root of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>sarsaparilla itself, with the bark scraped off; and, indeed,
its own root would serve well enough—were it
not that putting it to such a use would destroy its medicinal
value, and thus cause a considerable waste of the
costly material. The sarsaparilla is not to be had for
nothing even upon the banks of the Tapajos. A bundle
of the best quality does not leave the hands of the Mundrucu
until about four dollars’ worth of exchange commodities
have been put into them, which would bring
the price of it to something over sixpence a pound.
He is, therefore, a little particular about wasting a
material that has cost him—or rather his wife and
children—so much trouble in collecting. His cordage
is obtained more cheaply, and consists of the long, flexible
roots of a species of <i>pothos</i>, which roots—being
what are termed <i>aërial</i> and not buried in the ground—require
no labor or digging to get at them. It is only
necessary to stretch up the hand, and pull them down
from the tops of lofty trees, from which they hang like
streamers, often to the length of a hundred feet. These
are toughened by the bark being scraped off; and when
that is done they are ready for use, and serve not only to
tie up the bundles of sarsaparilla, but for many other
purposes in the domestic economy of the Mundrucus.</p>

<p class='c016'>In addition to the sarsaparilla, the Mundrucu furnishes
the trader with several other items of commercial
value—for his climate, although one of the most unhealthy
in all the Amazon region, on account of its great
heat and humidity, is for that very reason one of the
most fertile. Nearly all those tropical vegetable products
which are characteristics of Brazilian export commerce
can here be produced of the most luxuriant kind;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>but it is only those that grow spontaneously at his very
doors that tempt the Mundrucu to take the trouble of
collecting them.</p>

<p class='c016'>There is one article, however, which he not only takes
some trouble to collect, but also to manufacture into an
item of commercial exchange—a very rare item indeed.
This is the <i>guarana</i>, which is manufactured from the
fruit of a tree almost peculiar to the Mundrucu territory—since
nowhere is it found so abundantly as on the
Tapajos. It is so prized in the Brazilian settlements
as to command almost its weight in silver when transported
thither. It is the constituent element of a drink,
which has a stimulating effect on the system, somewhat
more powerful than tea or coffee. It will prevent sleep;
but its most valuable property is, that it is a good febrifuge,
equal to the best quinine. <i>Guarana</i> is prepared
from the seeds of an inga—one of the <i>Mimosacæ</i>. It
is a low, wide-spreading tree like most of the mimosa
family. The legumes are gathered, and the seeds
roasted in them. The latter are then taken out, and
after being ground to powder, are mixed with water
so as to make a tough paste, which is moulded into
little bricks, and when dried is ready for use. The
beverage is then prepared by scraping a table-spoonful
of dust from the brick, and mixing it with about a pint
of water; and the dry paste, keeping for any length of
time, is ready whenever wanted.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>guarana</i> bush grows elsewhere in the Amazon
valley, and on some head-waters of the Orinoco, where
certain tribes also know how to prepare the drink. But
it is sparingly distributed, and is nowhere so common
as on the upper Tapajos; hence its high price in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>markets of Brazil. The Mundrucu manufactures it, not
only for “home use,” but for “exportation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He prepares another singular article of luxury, and
this he makes exclusively for his own use,—not for the
gratification of his lips or palate, but for his nose,—in
other words, a snuff. Do not fancy, however, that it is
snuff of the ordinary kind—the pulverised produce of
innocent tobacco. No such thing; but a composition of
such a powerful and stimulating character, that he who
inhales it feels as if struck by an electric shock; his
body trembles; his eyes start forward as if they would
forsake their sockets; his limbs fail to support him;
and he drops to the earth like one in a state of intoxication!
For a short time he is literally mad; but the
fit is soon over,—lasting usually only a few minutes,—and
then a feeling of renewed strength, courage, and
joyousness succeeds. Such are the consequences of
taking snuff with a Mundrucu.</p>

<p class='c016'>And now to describe the nature of the substance
which produces these powerful effects.</p>

<p class='c016'>Like the <i>guarana</i> this snuff is a preparation, having
for its basis the seeds of a leguminous tree. This time,
however, it is an <i>acacia</i>, not an <i>inga</i>. It is the <i>acacia
niopo</i>; so called because “niopo” is the name given
to the snuff itself by certain tribes (the Ottomacs and
others), who, like the Mundrucus, are snuff-takers. It
is also called <i>curupa</i>, and the apparatus for preparing
and taking it—for there is an apparatus of an extensive
kind—is termed <i>parica</i>, in the general language
(<i>lingoa geral</i>) of the Amazonian regions.</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall describe the preparation, the apparatus, and
the ceremonial.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The pods of the <i>Acacia niopo</i>—a small tree, with
very delicate pinnate leaves—are plucked when ripe.
They are then cut into small pieces and flung into a
vessel of water. In this they remain until macerated,
and until the seeds have turned black. These are then
picked out, pounded in a mortar, which is usually the
pericarp of the <i>sapuçaia</i>, or “monkey-pot” tree (<i>Lecythis
ollaria</i>). The pounding reduces them to a paste,
which is taken up, clapped between the hands and
formed into little cakes—but not until it has been
mixed with some manioc flour, some lime from a burnt
shell (a <i>helix</i>), and a little juice from the fresh leaves
of the “abuta”—a menispermous plant of the genus
<i>Cocculus</i>. The cakes are then dried or “barbecued”
upon a primitive gridiron—the bars of which are saplings
of hard wood—and when well-hardened the snuff
is ready for the “box.” In a box it is actually carried—usually
one made out of some rare and beautiful
shell.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ceremonial of taking the snuff is the most singular
part of the performance. When a Mundrucu feels inclined
for a “pinch”—though it is something more than
a <i>pinch</i> that he inhales when he <i>does</i> feel inclined—he
takes the cake out of the box, scrapes off about a spoonful
of it into a shallow, saucer-shaped vessel of the calabash
kind, and then spreads the powder all over the
bottom of the vessel in a regular “stratification.” The
spreading is not performed by the fingers, but with a
tiny, pencil-like brush made out of the bristles of the
great ant-eater (<i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i>).</p>

<p class='c016'>He is in no hurry, but takes his time,—for as you
may guess from its effects, the performance is not one so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>often repeated as that of ordinary snuff-taking. When
the <i>niopo</i> dust is laid to his liking, another implement is
brought into play, the construction of which it is also
necessary to describe. It is a “machine” of six to eight
inches in length, and is made of two quills from the
wing of the <i>gaviao real</i>, or “harpy eagle” (<i>Harpyia
destructor</i>). These quills are placed side by side for
the greater part of their length, forming two parallel
tubes, and they are thus neatly whipped together by a
thread. At one end they are pressed apart so as to diverge
to a width corresponding to the breadth between
the Mundrucu’s nostrils,—where it is intended they
shall be placed during the ceremony of snuff-taking.</p>

<p class='c016'>And thus are they placed,—one end of each quill
being slightly intruded within the line of the septum,
while the other end rests upon the snuff, or wanders over
the surface of the saucer, till all the powder placed there
is drawn up and inhaled, producing the convulsive effects
already detailed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The shank-bone of a species of bird—thought to be
a plover—is sometimes used instead of the quills.
It is hollow, and has a forking-tube at the end. This
kind is not common or easily obtained, for the niopo-taker
who has one, esteems it as the most valuable item
of his apparatus.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snuffing the niopo is not exclusively confined to the
Mundrucu. We have seen elsewhere that it is also a
habit of the dirt-eating Ottomacs; and other tribes on
the upper Amazon practise it. But the Mahües, already
mentioned as the allies of the Mundrucus, are the most
confirmed snuff-takers of all.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another odd custom of the Mundrucus is their habit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of “tatooing.” I speak of real tatooing,—that is, marking
the skin with dots and lines that cannot be effaced,
in contradistinction to mere <i>painting</i>, or staining, which
can easily be washed off. The Mundrucus paint also,
with the <i>anotto</i>, <i>huitoc</i>, <i>caruta</i>, and other pigments, but
in this they only follow the practice of hundreds of other
tribes. The true <i>tatoo</i> is a far different affair, and scarcely
known among the aborigines of America, though common
enough in the islands of the South Sea. A few
other Indian tribes practise it to a limited extent,—as is
elsewhere stated,—but among the Mundrucus it is an
“institution;” and painful though the process be, it has
to be endured by every one in the nation, “every mother’s
son,” and daughter as well, that are cursed with a
Mundrucu for their father.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is upon the young people the infliction is performed,—when
they are about eight or ten years of age.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>tatoo</i> has been so often described, that I should
not repeat it here; but there are a few “points” peculiar
to Mundrucu tatooing, and a few others, not elsewhere
understood.</p>

<p class='c016'>The performance is usually the work of certain old
crones, who, from long practice, have acquired great skill
in the art.</p>

<p class='c016'>The chief instrument used is a comb of thorns,—not
a single thorn, as is generally stated,—but a tier or row
of them set comb-fashion. These thorns are the spines
of the “murumuru,” or “pupunha” palm (<i>Gullielmia
speciosa</i>). Humboldt states that this palm is smooth and
spineless, but in this the great, good man was in error.
Its trunk is so covered with thorns or spines, that when
the Indians require to climb it—for the purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>procuring the valuable fruits, which they eat variously
prepared—they have to erect a staging, or rude sort
of ladder, to be able to get at them.</p>

<p class='c016'>The comb, then, is pressed down upon the skin of the
“tatooee,” till all the points have penetrated the flesh,
and a row of holes is laid open, from which the blood
flows profusely. As soon as this can be wiped off, ashes
of a burnt gum or pitch are rubbed into the wounds,
which, when healed, appear like so many dots of a deep
bluish or black color. In this way the young Mundrucus,
both boys and girls, get those regular rows of dotted
lines, which traverse their forehead and cheeks, their
arms and limbs, breasts, and bodies in such eccentric
fashion. It has often been asked how these lines of dots
were carried over the skin in such straight and symmetrical
rows, forming regular parallel lines, or other geometrical
patterns. The “comb” will explain the mystery.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tatoo, with a few strings of shell-beads or necklaces,
and bracelets of monkey and jaguar teeth, is all
the dress which is permitted to the Mundrucu belle. In
Mundrucu-land it is the reverse of what is practised
among civilized people: the men are the exponents of
the fashions, and keep exclusively to themselves the cosmetics
and bijouterie. Not contented with being tatooed,
these also <i>paint</i> their bodies, by way of “overcoat,” and
also adorn themselves with the bright feathers of birds.
They wear on their heads the beautiful circlet of macaw
plumes, and on grand occasions appear in the magnificent
“feather dress,” so long celebrated as the peculiar costume
of the tropical-forest Indian. These dresses their
women weave and border, at a sacrifice of much tedious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>labor. They also ornament their arms and legs with
rows of feathers around them, the tips turned upward
and backward.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tatooing is confined to the Mundrucus proper,—their
allies, the Mahües not following the practice, but
contenting themselves with a simple “coat” of paint.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is difficult to say what motive first inducted human
beings into this singular and barbarous custom. It is
easier to tell why it is still followed, and the “why” is
answered by saying that the Mundrucus “scarify” themselves,
because their fathers did so before them. Many
a custom among civilized nations, but little less ridiculous,
if we could only think so, rests upon a similar basis.
Perhaps our modern abominable hat—though it has a
different origin—is not less ludicrous than the tatooed
patterns of the savage. Certainly it is quite equal to it
in ugliness, and is likely to rival it in permanence,—to
our sorrow be it said. But even <i>we</i> deal slightly in the
tatoo. Our jolly Jack would be nobody in the forecastle
without “Polly,” in blue, upon his weather-beaten breast,
and the <i>foul anchor</i> upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the Mundrucu baptizes his unfortunate offspring
in a still more savage fashion. The tattoo may be termed
the <i>baptism in blood</i>, performed at the tender age of ten.
When the youth—fortunately it does not extend to the
weaker sex—has attained to the age of eighteen, he has
then to undergo the <i>tocandeira</i>, which deserves to be
called <i>the baptism of fire</i>!</p>

<p class='c016'>This too merits description. When the Mundrucu
youth would become a candidate for manhood, a pair of
“gloves” is prepared for him. These consist of two
pieces of a palm-tree bark, with the pith hollowed out, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>left in at one end. The hollow part is of sufficient diameter
to draw over the hands loosely, and so long as to
reach up to mid-arm, after the fashion of gauntlets.</p>

<p class='c016'>The “gloves” being got ready, are nearly filled with
ants, not only the venomous red ants, but all other species,
large or small, that can either bite or sting, of which
tropical South America possesses an endless variety.
With this “lining” the  “mittens” are ready for use, and
the “novice” is compelled to draw them on. Should he
refuse, or even exhibit a disposition to shrink from the
fiery trial, he is a lost man. From that hour he need
never hold up his head, much less offer his hand and
heart, for there is not a maiden in all Mundrucu-land
that would listen to his softest speech. He is forever debarred
from the pleasure of becoming a benedict. Of
course he does not refuse, but plunging his hands into the
“mittens,” into the very midst of the crawling host, he
sets about the ceremony.</p>

<p class='c016'>He must keep on the gloves till he has danced before
every door in the village. He must sing as if from very
joy; and there is plenty of music to accompany him,
drums and fifes, and human voices,—for his parents and
relatives are by his side encouraging him with their
songs and gestures. He is in pain,—in positive agony,—for
these venomous ants both sting and bite, and
have been busy at both, from the very first moment.
Each moment his agony grows more intense, his sufferings
more acute, for the poison is thrilling through his
veins,—he turns pale,—his eyes become blood-cast,—his
breast quivers with emotion and his limbs tremble
beneath him; but despite all this, woe to him if he utter
a cry of weakness! It would brand him with an eternal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>stigma,—he would never be suffered to carry the Mundrucu
lance to battle,—to poise upon its point the ghastly
trophy of the <i>Beheaders</i>. On, on, through the howling
throng, amidst friends and relatives with faces anxious
as his own; on to the sound of the shrill-piping reed
and the hoarse booming of the Indian drum; on till he
stands in front of the cabin of the chief! There again
the song is sung, the “jig” is danced, both proudly prolonged
till the strength of the performer becomes completely
exhausted. Then, and not till then, the gloves
are thrown aside, and the wearer falls back, into the
arms of his friends, “sufficiently punished!”</p>

<p class='c016'>This is the hour of congratulation. Girls gather round
him, and fling their tatooed arms about his neck. They
cluster and cling upon him, singing his song of triumph;
but just at that crisis he is not in the mood for soft caresses;
and, escaping from their blandishments, he makes
a rush towards the river. On reaching its bank he plunges
bodily in, and there remains up to his neck in the water,
till the cooling fluid has to some extent eased his aching
arms, and tranquillized the current of his boiling blood.
When he emerges from the water, he is a man, fit stuff
for a Mundrucu warrior, and eligible to the hand of a
Mundrucu maiden.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be remarked that this terrible ordeal of the
Mundrucus, though, perhaps, peculiar among South-American
Indians, has its parallel among certain tribes
of the north,—the Mandans and others, as detailed by
Catlin, one of the most acute of ethnological observers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>scalp trophy</i>, too, of the Northern Indian has its
analogy in a Mundrucu custom—that which distinguishes
him most of all, and which has won him the terrible
title of “Beheader.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>This singular appellation is now to be explained.</p>

<p class='c016'>When a Mundrucu has succeeded in killing an enemy,
he is not, like his northern compeer, satisfied with only
the skin of the head. <i>He must have the whole head</i>,
scalp and skull, bones, brains, and all! And he takes
all, severing the head with his knife by a clean cut across
the small of the neck, and leaving the trunk to the vulture
king. With the ghastly trophy poised upon the
point of his lance, he returns triumphant to the malocca
to receive the greetings of his tribe and the praises of
his chief.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the warlike exploit requires a memento—some
token by which he may perpetuate its fame. The art of
printing does not exist among the Mundrucus, and there
is no <i>friendly</i> pen to record the deed. It has been done,—behold
the evidence! much clearer than often accompanies
the exploits of civilized heroes. There is the evidence
of an enemy slain; there is the grim, gory voucher,
palpable both to sight and touch—proof positive that
there is a dead body somewhere.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course, such evidence is sufficient for the present;
but how about the future? As time passes, the feat may
be forgotten, as great deeds are elsewhere. Somebody may
even deny it. Some slanderous tongue may whisper, or
insinuate, or openly declare that it was no exploit after
all—that there was no dead man; for the vultures by
this time would have removed the body, and the white
ants (<i>termites</i>) would have equally extinguished all
traces of the bones. How, then, are the proofs to be
preserved? <i>By preserving the head!</i> And this is the
very idea that is in the mind of the Mundrucu warrior.
He is resolved not to permit his exploit to be buried in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>oblivion by <i>burying the head</i> of his enemy. That tongue,
though mute, will tell the tale to posterity; that pallid
cheek, though, perhaps, it may become a little shrivelled
in the “drying,” will still be smooth enough to show that
there is no <i>tatoo</i>, and to be identified as the skin of an enemy.
Some young Mundrucu, yet unborn, will read in
the countenance of that grinning and gory witness, the
testimony of his father’s prowess. The head, therefore,
must be preserved; and it is preserved with as much
care as the cherished portrait of a famous ancestor. The
cranial relic is even <i>embalmed</i>, as if out of affection for
him to whom it belonged. The brains and eye-balls are
removed, to facilitate the process of desiccation; but false
eyes are inserted, and the tongue, teeth, and ears, scalp,
skull, and hair, are all retained, not only retained, but
“titivated” out in the most approved style of fashion.
The long hair is carefully combed out, parted, and arranged;
brilliant feathers of rock-cock and macaw are
planted behind the ears and twisted in the hanging
tresses. An ornamental string passes through the tongue,
and by this the trophy is suspended from the beams of
the great malocca.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not permitted to remain there. In some dark
niche of this Golgotha—this Mundruquin Westminster—it
might be overlooked and forgotten. To prevent
this it is often brought forth, and receives many an airing.
On all warlike and festive occasions does it appear,
poised upon the point of the warrior’s lance, and even
in peaceful times it may be seen—along with hundreds
of its like—placed in the circular row around the
manioc clearing, and lending its demure countenance to
the labors of the field.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>It is not a little singular that this custom of embalming
the heads of their enemies is found among the Dyaks
of Borneo, and the process in both places is ludicrously
similar. Another rare coincidence occurs between the
Amazonian tribes and the Bornean savages, viz. in both
being provided with the blow-gun. The <i>gravitana</i> of
the American tribes is almost identical with the sumpitan
of Borneo. It furnishes a further proof of our
theory regarding an original connection between the
American Indians and the savages of the great South
Sea.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Mundrucu is rarely ill off in the way of food.
When he is so, it is altogether his own fault, and chargeable
to his indolent disposition. The soil of his territory
is of the most fertile kind, and produces many kinds
of edible fruits spontaneously, as the nuts of the <i>pupunha</i>
palm and the splendid fruits of the <i>Bertholetia excelsa</i>,
or juvia-tree, known in Europe as “Brazil-nuts.” Of
these then are two kinds, as mentioned elsewhere, the second
being a tree of the genus <i>Lecythys</i>,—the <i>Lecythys
ollaria</i>, or “monkey-pot” tree. It obtains this trivial
name from the circumstance, first, of its great pericarp,
almost as large as a child’s head, having a movable top
or lid, which falls off when the fruit ripens; and secondly,
from the monkeys being often seen drawing the seeds
or nuts out of that part of the shell which remains
attached to the tree, and which, bearing a considerable
resemblance to a pot in its shape, is thus very appropriately
designated the pot of the monkeys. The common
Indian name of the monkey-pot tree is <i>sapucaya</i>,
and the nuts of this species are so called in commerce,
though they are also termed Brazil-nuts. They are of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>more agreeable flavor than the true Brazil-nuts, and not
so easily obtained, as the <i>Lecythys</i> is less generally distributed
over the Amazonian valley. It requires a peculiar
soil, and grows only in those tracts that are subject
to the annual inundations of the rivers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The true Brazil-nuts are the “juvia” trees of the
Indians; and the season for collecting them is one of the
<i>harvests</i> of the Mundrucu people. The great pericarps—resembling
large cocoa-nuts when stripped of the
fibres—do not open and shed their seeds, as is the case
with the monkey-pot tree. The whole fruit falls at
once; and as it is very heavy, and the branches on
which it grows are often nearly a hundred feet from the
ground, it may easily be imagined that it comes down
like a ten-pound shot; in fact, one of them falling upon
the head of a Mundrucu would be very likely to crush
his cranium, as a bullet would an egg-shell; and such
accidents not unfrequently occur to persons passing imprudently
under the branches of the Bertholetia when
its nuts are ripe. Sometimes the monkeys, when on the
ground looking after those that have fallen, become victims
to the like accident; but these creatures are cunning
reasoners, and being by experience aware of the
danger, will scarce ever go under a juvia-tree, but when
passing one always make a wide circuit around it. The
monkeys cannot of themselves open the great pericarp,
as they do that of the “sapucuya,” but are crafty enough
to get at the precious contents, notwithstanding. In
doing this they avail themselves of the help of other
creatures, that have also a motive in opening the
juvia shells—cavies and other small rodent animals,
whose teeth, formed for this very purpose, enable them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to gnaw a hole in the ligneous pericarps, hard and thick
as they are. Meanwhile the monkeys, squatted around,
watch the operation in a careless, nonchalant sort of way,
as if they had no concern whatever in the result; but as
soon as they perceive that an entrance has been effected,
big enough to admit their hand, they rush forward, drive
off the weaker creature, who has been so long and laboriously
at work, and take possession of the prize.</p>

<p class='c016'>Neither does the Mundrucu nut-gatherer get possession
of the juvia fruit without a certain degree of danger
and toil. He has to climb the tallest trees, to secure the
whole crop at one time; and while engaged in collecting
those upon the ground, he is in danger of a blow from
odd ones that are constantly falling. To secure his skull
against accidents, he wears upon his head a thick wooden
cap or helmet,—after the fashion of the hats worn by
our firemen,—and he is always careful to keep his body
in an upright attitude, stooping as seldom as he can avoid
doing so, lest he might get a thump between the shoulders,
or upon the spine of his back, which would be very
likely to flatten him out upon the earth. These Brazil-nuts
furnish the Mundrucu with a portion of his food,—as
they also do many other tribes of Amazonian Indians,—and
they are also an item of Indian commerce, being
collected from among the different tribes by the Portuguese
and Spanish traders.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the Mundrucu does not depend altogether on the
spontaneous productions of the forest, which at best
furnish only a precarious supply. He does something in
the agricultural line,—cultivating a little manioc root,
with plantains, yams, and other tropical plants that produce
an enormous yield with the very slightest trouble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>or attention; and this is exactly what suits him. A few
days spent by the little community in the yam patch—or
rather, by the women and children, for these are the
agricultural laborers in Mundrucu land—is sufficient to
ensure an abundant supply of breadstuff for the whole
year. With regard to flesh-meat he is net so well off,
for the domestic animals, and oxen more especially, do
not thrive in the Amazon country. In Mundrucu land,
the carnivorous jaguar, aided by flies and vampire bats,
would soon destroy them, even if the Indian had the
inclination to raise them, which he has not.</p>

<p class='c016'>Instead of beef, therefore, he contents himself with
fish, and occasionally a steak from the great tapir, or
a griskin of <i>manati</i>. Birds, too, furnish him with an
occasional meal; but the staple article of his flesh diet
is obtained from the <i>quadrumana</i>,—the numerous species
of monkeys with which his forests abound. These
he obtains by shooting them down from the trees with
his bow and arrows, and also by various other hunting
devices.</p>

<p class='c016'>His mode of cooking them is sufficiently peculiar to
be described. A large log fire is first kindled and permitted
to burn until a sufficient quantity of red cinders
are produced. Over these cinders a grating is erected
with green saplings of wood, laid parallel to each other
like the bars of a gridiron, and upon this the “joint” is
laid.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nothing is done to the monkey before its being placed
on the gridiron. Its skin is not removed, and even the
intestines are not always taken out. The fire will singe
off the hair sufficiently to content a Mundrucu stomach,
and the hide is broiled and eaten with the flesh. It is
thus literally “carne con cuero.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>It may be observed that this forest gridiron, or “barbecue,”
as it is properly termed, is not an idea exclusively
confined to South America. It is in use among
the Indians of the north, and various uncivilized tribes
in other parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sometimes the Mundrucu does not take the trouble to
construct the gridiron. When on the march in some
warlike expedition that will not allow time for being
particular about the mode of cooking, the joint is broiled
upon a spit over the common fire. The spit is simply a
stick, sharpened at both ends, one of which impales the
monkey, and the other is stuck into the ground. The
stick is then set with a lean towards the fire, so as to
bring the carcass over the blaze. While on the spit the
monkey appears in a sitting position, with its head upward,
and its long tail hanging along the sapling,—just
as if it were still living, and in one of its most natural
attitudes, clinging to the branch of a tree! The sight is
sufficiently comical; but sometimes a painful spectacle
has been witnessed,—painful to any one but a savage:
when the young of the monkey has been captured along
with its dam, and still recognizing the form of its parent,—even
when all the hair has been singed off, and the
skin has become calcined by the fire,—is seen rushing
forward into the very flames, and with plaintive cry inviting
the maternal embrace! Such an affecting incident
has been often witnessed amid the forests of Amazonia.</p>

<p class='c016'>We conclude our sketch of the Mundrucus, by stating
that their form of government is despotic, though not to
an extreme degree. The “tushao,” or chief, has considerable
power, though it is not absolute, and does not
extend to the taking of life,—unless the object of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>displeasure be a slave, and many of these are held in
abject bondage among the Mundrucus.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Mundrucu religion resembles that of many other
tribes both in North and South America. It consists in
absurd ceremonies, and appeals to the good and evil
spirits of the other world, and is mixed up with a vast
deal of quackery in relation to the ills that afflict the
Mundrucu in this life. In other words, it is a combination
of the priest and doctor united in one, that arch-charlatan
known to the North-American Indians as
the “Medicine-man,” and among the Mundrucus as the
“Puge.”</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE CENTAURS OF THE “GRAN CHACO.”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>I have elsewhere stated that a broad band of independent
Indian territory—that is, territory never
really subdued or possessed by the Spaniards—traverses
the interior of South America, extending longitudinally
throughout the whole continent. Beginning at
Cape Horn, it ends in the peninsula of the free <i>Goajiros</i>,
which projects into the Caribbean Sea,—in other words,
it is nearly 5,000 miles in length. In breadth it varies
much. In Patagonia and a portion of the Pampas
country it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and
it is of still wider extent on the latitude of the Amazon
river, where the whole country, from the Atlantic to the
Peruvian Andes,—with the exception of some thinly-placed
Brazilian settlements,—is occupied by tribes of
independent Indians. At either point this territory will
appear—upon maps—to be interrupted by tracts of
country possessing civilized settlements. The names of
towns and villages are set as thickly as if the country
were well peopled; and numerous roads are traced,
forming a labyrinthine network upon the paper. A
broad belt of this kind extends from the Lower Parana
(La Plata) to the Andes of Chili, constituting the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>provinces of the “Argentine Confederation;” another
apparently joins the settlements of Bolivia and Brazil
and again in the north, the provinces of Venezuela appear
to be united to those of New Granada.</p>

<p class='c016'>All this, however, is more apparent than real. The
towns upon the maps are in general mere <i>rancherias</i>, or
collections of huts; some of them are the names of fortified
posts, and a large proportion are but ruins,—the
ruins of monkish mission settlements long since gone to
destruction, and with little else than the name on the
map to testify that they ever had an existence. The
roads are no roads at all, nothing more than tracings on
the chart showing the general route of travel.</p>

<p class='c016'>Even across the Argentine provinces—where this
nomenclature appears thickest upon the map—the
horse-Indian of the Pampas extends his forays at will;
his “range” meeting, and, in some cases, “dovetailing”
into that of the tribes dwelling upon the northern side of
these settlements. The latter, in their turn, carry their
plundering expeditions across to the Campos Parexis, on
the head-waters of the Amazon, whence stretches the independent
territory, far and wide to the Amazon itself;
thence to the Orinoco, and across the <i>Llanos</i> to the shores
of the Maracaibo Gulf—the free range of the independent
Goajiros.</p>

<p class='c016'>This immense belt of territory, then, is in actual possession
of the aborigines. Although occupied at a few
points by the white race,—Spanish and Portuguese,—the
occupation scarce deserves the name. The settlements
are sparse and rather <i>retrograde</i> than <i>progressive</i>.
The Indian ranges through and around them, wherever
and whenever his inclination leads him; and only when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>some humiliating treaty has secured him a temporary
respite from hostilities does the colonist enjoy tranquillity.
At other times he lives in continual dread, scarce daring
to trust himself beyond the immediate vicinity of his
house or village, both of which he has been under the
necessity of fortifying.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is true that at one period of South-American history
things were not quite so bad. When the Spanish
nation was at the zenith of its power a different condition
existed; but even then, in the territory indicated,
there were large tracts circumstanced just as at the present
hour,—tracts which the Spaniards, with all their
boasted warlike strength, were unable even to <i>explore</i>,
much less to subdue. One of these was that which
forms the subject of our sketch, “El Gran Chaco.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Of all the tracts of wild territory existing in South
America, and known by the different appellations of
<i>Pampas</i>, <i>Paramos</i>, <i>Campos Parexis</i>, the <i>Puna</i>, the <i>Pajonal</i>,
<i>Llanos</i>, and <i>Montañas</i>, there is none possessed of a
greater interest than that of <i>El Gran Chaco</i>,—perhaps
not one that equals it in this respect. It is interesting,
not only from having a peculiar soil, climate, and productions,
but quite as much from the character and history
of its inhabitants, both of which present us with
traits and episodes truly romantic.</p>

<p class='c016'>The “Gran Chaco” is 200,000 square miles in extent,
or twice the size of the British Isles. Its eastern boundary
is well defined, being the Paraguay river, and its
continuation the Parana, down to the point where the latter
receives one of its great western tributaries, the Salado;
and this last is usually regarded as the southern and
western boundary of the Chaco. Northward its limits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>are scarcely so definite; though the highlands of Bolivia
and the old missionary province of Chiquitos, forming
the water-shed between the rivers of the La Plata and
the Amazonian basins—may be geographically regarded
as the termination of the Chaco in that direction. North
and south it extends through eleven degrees of latitude;
east and west it is of unequal breadth,—sometimes expanding,
sometimes contracting, according to the ability
of the white settlers along it borders to maintain their
frontier. On its eastern side, as already stated, the frontier
is definite, and terminates on the banks of the Paraguay
and Parana. East of this line—coinciding almost
with a meridian of longitude—the Indian of the Gran
Chaco does not roam, the well-settled province of Corrientes
and the dictatorial government of Paraguay presenting
a firmer front of resistance; but neither does the
colonist of these countries think of crossing to the western
bank of the boundary river to form any establishment
there. He dares not even set his foot upon the territory
of the Chaco. For a thousand miles, up and down, the
two races, European and American, hold the opposite
banks of this great stream. They gaze across at each
other: the one from the portico of his well-built mansion,
or perhaps from the street of his town; the other,
standing by his humble “toldo,” or mat-covered tent,—more
probably, upon the back of his half-wild horse,
reined up for a moment on some projecting promontory
that commands the view of the river. And thus have
these two races gazed at each other for three centuries,
with little other intercourse passing between them than
that of a deadly hostility.</p>

<p class='c016'>The surface of the Gran Chaco is throughout of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>champaign character. It may be described as a vast
plain. It is not, however, a continuation of the Pampas,
since the two are separated by a more broken tract of
country, in which lie the sierras of Cordova and San
Luis, with the Argentine settlements already mentioned.
Besides, the two great plains differ essentially in their
character, even to a greater extent than do the Pampas
themselves from the desert steppes of Patagonia. Only
a few of the annual and vegetable productions of the
Gran Chaco are identical with those of the Pampas, and
its Indian inhabitants are altogether unlike the sanguinary
savages of the more southern plain. The Chaco, approaching
many degrees nearer to the equator, is more
tropical in its character; in fact, the northern portion of
it is truly so, lying as it does within the torrid zone, and
presenting the aspect of a tropical vegetation. Every
inch of the Chaco is within the palm region; but in its
northern half these beautiful trees abound in numberless
species, yet unknown to the botanist, and forming the
characteristic features of the landscape. Some grow in
forests of many miles in extent, others only in “clumps,”
with open, grass-covered plains between, while still other
species mingle their graceful fronds with the leaves and
branches of dicotyledonous trees, or clapsed in the embrace
of luxuriant llianas and parasitical climbers form
groves of the most variegated verdure and fantastic outlines.
With such groves the whole surface of the Chaco
country is enamelled; the intervals between being occupied
by plains of rich waving grass, now and then tracts
of morass covered with tall and elegant reeds, a few arid
spots bristling with singular forms of <i>algarobia</i> and <i>cactus</i>,
and, in some places, isolated rocky mounds, of dome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>or conical shape, rising above the general level of the
plains, as if intended to be used as watch-towers for their
guardianship and safety.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such are the landscapes which the Grand Chaco presents
to the eye—far different from the bald and uniform
monotony exhibited in the aspect of either Prairie
or Pampa; far grander and lovelier than either—in
point of scenic loveliness, perhaps, unequalled on earth.
No wonder, then, that the Indian of South America
esteems it as an earthly Elysium; no wonder that the
Spaniard dreams of it as such,—though to the Spanish
priest and the Spanish soldier it has ever proved more
of a Purgatory than a Paradise. Both have entered
upon its borders, but neither has been able to dwell
within its domain; and the attempts at its conquest,
by sword and cross, have been alike unsuccessful,—equally
and fatally repulsed, throughout a period of more
than three hundred years. At this hour, as at the time
of the Peruvian conquest,—as on the day when the
ships of Mendoza sailed up the waters of the Parana,—the
Gran Chaco is an unconquered country, owned by
its aboriginal inhabitants, and by them alone. It is true
that it is <i>claimed</i>, both by Spaniard and Portuguese;
and by no less than four separate claimants belonging to
these two nationalities. Brazil and Bolivia, Paraguay
and the Argentine Confederation, all assert their title to
a slice of this earthly paradise; and even quarrel as to
how their boundary lines should intersect it!</p>

<p class='c016'>There is something extremely ludicrous in these
claims,—since neither one nor other of the four powers
can show the slightest basis for them. Not one of them
can pretend to the claim of conquest; and far less can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>they rest their rights upon the basis of occupation of
possession. So far from possessing the land, not one of
them dare set foot over its borders; and they are only
too well pleased if its present occupants are contented
to remain within them. The claim, therefore, of both
Spaniard and Portuguese, has no higher title, than that
some three hundred and fifty years ago it was given
them by the Pope,—a title not less ludicrous than their
kissing the Pope’s toe to obtain it!</p>

<p class='c016'>In the midst of these four conflicting claimants, there
appears a fifth, and that is the real owner,—the “red
Indian” himself. His claim has “three points of the
law” in his favor,—possession,—and perhaps the
fourth, too,—the power to keep possession. At all
events, he has held it for three hundred years against
all odds and all comers; and who knows that he may
not hold it for three hundred years more?—only, it is
to be hoped, for a different use, and under the influence
of a more progressive civilization.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Indian, then, is the undoubted lord of the “Gran
Chaco.” Let us drop in upon him, and see what sort
of an Indian he is, and how he manages this majestic
domain.</p>

<p class='c016'>After having feasted our eyes upon the rich scenery
of the land,—upon the verdant plains, mottled with
copses of “quebracho” and clumps of the <i>Caranday</i>
palm,—upon landscapes that resemble the most lordly
parks, we look around for the mansions and the owners.
The mansion is not there, but the owner stands before
us.</p>

<p class='c016'>We are at once struck by his appearance: his person
tall and straight as a reed, his frame muscular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>his limbs round and well-proportioned, piercing coal-black
eyes, well-formed features, and slightly aquiline
nose,—and perhaps we are a little surprised at the light
color of his skin. In this we note a decided peculiarity
which distinguishes him from most other tribes of his
race. It is not a <i>red</i> Indian we behold, nor yet a <i>copper-colored</i>
savage; but a man whose complexion is
scarce darker than that of the mulatto, and not at all
deeper in hue than many a Spaniard of Andalusian
descent, who boasts possession of the purest “sangre
azul;” not one shade darker than thousands of Portuguese
dwelling upon the other side of the Brazilian frontier.</p>

<p class='c016'>And remember, that it is the <i>true</i> skin of the Chaco
Indian we have before our view,—and not a <i>painted</i>
one,—for here, almost for the first time, do we encounter
the native complexion of the aboriginal, undisfigured
by those horrid pigments which in these pages have so
often glared before the eyes of our readers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of paint, the Chaco Indian scarce knows the use; or,
at all events, employs it sparingly, and only at intervals,
on very particular and ceremonial occasions. We are
spared, therefore, the describing his <i>escutcheon</i>, and a
positive relief it is.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would be an interesting inquiry to trace out the
cause of his thus abstaining from a custom almost universal
among his race. Why does he abjure the paint?</p>

<p class='c016'>Is it because he cannot afford it, or that it is not procurable
in his country? No; neither of these can be
offered as a reason. The “annotto” bush (<i>Bixa orellana</i>),
and the wild-indigo, abound in his territory; and
he knows how to extract the colors of both,—for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>women do extract them, and use them in dying the yarn
of their webs. Other dyewoods—a multitude of others—he
could easily obtain; and even the cochineal cactus,
with its gaudy vermilion parasite, is indigenous to his
land. It cannot be the scarcity of the material that prevents
him from employing it,—what then?</p>

<p class='c016'>The cause is unexplained; but may it not be that this
romantic savage, otherwise more highly gifted than the
rest of his race, is endowed also with a truer sense of the
beautiful and becoming? <i>Quien sabe?</i></p>

<p class='c016'>Let it not be understood, however, that he is altogether
free from the “taint,”—for he <i>does</i> paint sometimes, as
already admitted; and it must be remembered, moreover,
that the Chaco Indians are not all of one tribe, nor
of one community. There are many associations of them
scattered over the face of this vast plain, who are not all
alike, either in their habits or customs, but, on the contrary,
very unlike; who are not even at all times friendly
with each other, but occupied with feuds and <i>vendettas</i>
of the most deadly description. Some of these tribes
paint most frightfully, while others of them go still farther,
and <i>scarify</i> their faces with the indelible <i>tattoo</i>,—a
custom that in America is almost confined to the Indians
of the Chaco and a few tribes on the southern
tributaries of the Amazon. Happily this custom is on
the decline: the men practise it no longer; but, by a
singular perversity of taste, it is still universal among
the women, and no Chaco belle would be esteemed beautiful
without a cross of bluish-black dots upon her forehead,
a line of like points extending from the angle of
each eye to the ears, with a variety of similar markings
upon her cheeks, arms, and bosom. All this is done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>with the point of a thorn,—the spine of a <i>mimosa</i>, or
of the <i>caraguatay</i> aloe; and the dark purple color is
obtained by infusing charcoal into the fresh and bleeding
punctures. It is an operation that requires days to complete,
and the pain from it is of the most acute and prolonged
character, enduring until the poisoned wounds
become cicatrized. And yet it is borne without a murmur,—just
as people in civilized life bear the painful
application of hair-dyes and tweezers.</p>

<p class='c016'>I need not say that the hair of the Chaco Indian does
not need to be dyed,—that is, unless he were to fancy
having it of a white, or a red, or yellow color,—not an
uncommon fancy among savages.</p>

<p class='c016'>His taste, however, does not run that way any more
than among civilized dandies, and he is contented with
its natural hue, which is that of the raven’s wing. But
he is not contented to leave it to its natural growth.
Only a portion of it,—that which covers the upper part
of his head,—is permitted to retain its full length and
flowing glories. For the remainder, he has a peculiar
<i>tonsure</i> of his own; and the hair immediately over the
forehead—and sometimes a stripe running all around
above the ears, to the back of the head—is either close
shaven with a sharp shell, or plucked entirely out by a
pair of horn tweezers of native manufacture. Were it
not that the long and luxuriant tresses that still remain,—covering
his crown, as with a crest,—the shorn circle
would assimilate him to some orders of friars; but, notwithstanding
the similarity of tonsure, there is not much
resemblance between a Chaco Indian and a brother of
the crucifix and cowl.</p>

<p class='c016'>This mode of “dressing the hair” is not altogether peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>to the Indian of the Gran Chaco. It is also practised
by certain prairie tribes,—the Osage, Pawnee, and
two or three others; but all these carry the “razor” a
little higher up, leaving a mere patch, or “scalp-lock,”
upon the crown.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Chaco tribes are beardless by nature; and if a
few hairs chance to show themselves upon cheek or chin,
they are carefully “wed” out. In a like fashion both
men and women serve their eyebrows and lashes,—sacrificing
these undoubted ornaments, as they say, to a
principle of utility, since they allege that they can <i>see
better without them</i>! They laugh at white men, who
preserve these appendages, calling them “ostrich-eyed,”—from
a resemblance which they perceive between
hairy brows and the stiff, hair-like feathers that bristle
round the eyes of the rhea, or American ostrich,—a
well-known denizen of the Gran Chaco.</p>

<p class='c016'>The costume of the Chaco Indian is one of exceeding
simplicity; and in this again we observe a peculiar trait
of his mind. Instead of the tawdry and tinsel ornaments,
in which most savages delight to array themselves,
he is contented with a single strip of cloth, folded
tightly around his loins. It is usually either a piece of
white cotton, or of wool woven in a tri-color of red,
white, and blue, and of hues so brilliant, as to produce
altogether a pretty effect. The wear of the women
scarce differs from that of the men, and the covering of
both, scant as it is, is neither inelegant nor immodest. It
is well adapted to their mode of life, and to their climate,
which is that of an eternal spring. When cold winds
sweep over their grassy plains, they seek protection
under the folds of a more ample covering, with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>they are provided,—a cloak usually made of the soft
fur of the “nutria,” or South-American otter, or a robe
of the beautiful spotted skin of the jaguar. They wear
neither head-dress nor <i>chaussure</i>,—neither pendants from
the nose, nor the hideous lip ornaments seen among other
tribes of South America; but many of them pierce the
ears; and more especially the women, who split the delicate
lobes, and insert into them spiral appendages of
rolled palm-leaf, that hang dangling to their very shoulders.
It will be observed, therefore, that among the
Chaco tribes the women disfigure themselves more than
the men, and all, no doubt, in the interest of <i>fashion</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It will be seen that the simple dress we have described
leaves the limbs and most part of the body bare. To
the superficial observer it might be deemed an inelegant
costume, and perhaps so it would be among Europeans,
or so-called “whites.” The deformed figures of European
people—deformed by ages of toil and monarchical
serfdom—would ill bear exposure to the light, neither
would the tripe-colored skin, of which they are so commonly
conceited. A very different impression is produced
by the rich brunette hue,—bronze, if you will,—especially
when, as in the case of the Chaco Indian, it
covers a body of proper shape, with arms and limbs in
symmetrical proportion. Then, and then only, does
costly clothing appear superfluous, and the eye at once
admits that there is no fashion on earth equal to that of
the human form itself.</p>

<p class='c016'>Above all does it appear graceful on horseback, and
almost universally in this attitude does the Chaco Indian
exhibit it. Scarce ever may we meet him afoot, but
always on the back of his beautiful horse,—the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>together presenting the aspect of the Centaur. And
probably in the resemblance he approaches nearer to
the true ideal of the Grecian myth, than any other horseman
in the world; for the Chaco Indians differ not only
from other “horse-Indians” in their mode of equitation,
but also from every other equestrian people. The absurd
high-peaked saddles of Tartar and Arab, with their
gaudy trappings, are unknown to him,—unknown, too,
the ridiculous paraphernalia, half-hiding the horse, in use
among Mexicans, South-American Spaniards, and even
the Indians of other tribes,—despised by him the plated
bits, the embroidered bridles, and the tinkling spurs, so
tickling to the vanity of other New-World equestrians.
The Chaco horseman needs no such accessories to his
elegance. Saddle he has none, or only the slightest
patch of jaguar-skin,—spurs and stirrups are alike absent.
Naked he sits upon his naked horse, the beautiful
curvature of whose form is interrupted by no extraneous
trappings,—even the thong that guides him scarce observable
from its slightness. Who then can deny his
resemblance to the centaur?</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus mounted, with no other saddle than that described,
no bridle but a thin strip of raw hide looped
around the lower jaw of his horse, he will gallop wildly
over the plain, wheel in graceful curves to avoid the burrows
of the <i>viscacha</i>, pass at full speed through the close-standing
and often thorny trunks of the palms, or, if need
be, stand erect upon the withers of his horse, like a “star
rider” of the Hippodrome. In this attitude he looks
abroad for his enemies, or the game of which he may be
in search; and, thus elevated above surrounding objects,
he discovers the ostrich far off upon the plain, the large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>deer (<i>cervus campestris</i>), and the beautiful spotted roebucks
that browse in countless herds upon the grass-covered
savannas.</p>

<p class='c016'>The dwelling of the Chaco Indian is a tent, not covered
with skins, but usually with mats woven from the
epidermis of young leaves of a palm-tree. It is set up
by two long uprights and a ridge-pole, over which the
mat is suspended—very much after the fashion of the
<i>tente d’abri</i> used by Zouave soldiers. His bed is a hammock,
swung between the upright poles, or oftener, between
two palm-trees growing near. He only seeks
shelter in his tent when it rains, and he prevents its floor
getting wet by digging a trench around the outside. He
cares little for exposure to the sun; but his wife is more
delicate, and usually carries over her head a large bunch
of <i>rhea</i> feathers, <i>à la parasol</i>, which protects her face
from the hot scorching beams.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tent does not stand long in one situation. Ample
as is the supply which Nature affords in the wilds of the
Chaco, it is not all poured out in any one place. This
would be too much convenience, and would result in an
evil consequence. The receiver of such a benefit would
soon become indolent, from the absence of all necessity
for exertion; and not only his health, but his moral
nature, would suffer from such abundance.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fortunately no such fate is likely to befall the Indian
of the Chaco. The food upon which he subsists is derived
from many varied sources, a few of which only are
to be found in any one particular place, and each only at
its own season of the year. For instance, upon the dry
plains he pursues the <i>rhea</i> and <i>viscacha</i>, the jaguar, puma,
and partridges; in woods and marshy places the different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>species of wild hogs (peccaries). On the banks of rivers
he encounters the tapir and capivara, and in their waters,
fish, <i>utrias</i>, geese, and ducks. In the denser forest-covered
tracts he must look for the various kinds of
monkeys, which also constitute a portion of his food.
When he would gather the legumes, of the <i>algarobias</i>—of
several species—or collects the sugary sap of the
<i>caraguatay</i>, he must visit the tracts where the <i>mimosæ</i>
and <i>bromelias</i> alone flourish; and then he employs much
of his time in searching for the nests of wild bees, from
the honey of which and the seeds of the <i>algarobia</i> he
distils a pleasant but highly intoxicating drink. To his
credit, however, he uses this but sparingly, and only upon
grand occasions of ceremony; how different from the
bestial chicha-drinking revellers of the Pampas!</p>

<p class='c016'>These numerous journeys, and the avocations connect
with them, hinder the Chaco Indian from falling into habits
of idleness, and preserve his health to a longevity that
is remarkable: so much so, that “to live as long as a
Chaco Indian,” has become a proverbial expression in the
settlements of South America.</p>

<p class='c016'>The old Styrian monk Dobrezhoffer has chronicled
the astounding facts, that among these people a man of
eighty is reckoned to be in the prime of manhood; that
a hundred years is accounted a common age; and that
many of them are still hale and hearty at the age
of one hundred and twenty! Allowing for a little exaggeration
in the statements of the monk, it is nevertheless
certain that the Indians of the Gran Chaco, partly
owing to their fine climate, and partly to their mode of
life and subsistence, enjoy health and strength to a very
old age, and to a degree unknown in less-favored regions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of the world. Of this there is ample and trustworthy
testimony.</p>

<p class='c016'>The food of the Chaco Indian is of a simple character,
and he makes no use either of salt or spices. He is usually
the owner of a small herd of cattle and a few sheep,
which he has obtained by plundering the neighboring settlements
of the Spaniards. It is towards those of the
south and west that he generally directs his hostile forays;
for he is at peace with the riverine provinces,—Brazilian,
Paraguayan, and Correntine.</p>

<p class='c016'>In these excursions he travels long distances, crossing
many a fordless stream and river, and taking along with
him wife, children, tents, and utensils, in short, everything
which he possesses. He fords the streams by swimming,
using one hand to guide his horse. With this hand he
can also propel himself, while in the other he carries his
long lance, on the top of which he poises any object he
does not wish should be wetted. A “balza,” called “pelota,”
made of bull’s hide, and more like a square box
than a boat, carries over the house utensils and the puppies,
of which there are always a large number. The
“precious baby” is also a passenger by the balza. The
<i>pelota</i> is propelled, or rather, pulled over, by means of a
tiller-rope, held in the teeth of a strong swimmer, or tied
to the tail of a horse; and thus the crossing is effected.</p>

<p class='c016'>Returning with his plunder—with herds of horned
cattle or flocks of sheep—not unfrequently with human
captives, women and children, the crossing becomes more
difficult; but he is certain to effect it without loss, and
almost without danger of being overtaken in the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c016'>His freebooting habits should not be censured too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>gravely. Many extenuating circumstances must be
taken into consideration,—his wrongs and sanguinary
persecutions. It must be remembered that the hostilities
commenced on the opposite side; and with the Indian
the habit is not altogether indigenous, but rather
the result of the principle of retaliation. He is near
kindred to the <i>Incas</i>,—in fact, some of the Chaco
tribes are remnants of the scattered Peruvian race, and
he still remembers the sanguinary slaughter of his ancestors
by the Pizarros and Almagros. Therefore, using
the phraseology of the French tribunals, we may say
there are “extenuating circumstances in his favor.” One
circumstance undoubtedly speaks trumpet-tongued for the
Chaco Indian; and that is, he does not <i>torture</i> his captives,
even when <i>white</i> men have fallen into his hands!
As to the captive women and children, their treatment is
rather gentle than otherwise; in fact, they are adopted
into the tribe, and share, alike with the rest, the pleasures
as well as the hardships of a savage life.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the Chaco Indian possesses horned cattle and
sheep, he eats mutton and beef; but if these are wanting,
he must resort to the chase. He captures deer and
ostriches by running them down with his swift steed,
and piercing them with his long spear; and occasionally
he uses the <i>bolas</i>. For smaller game he employs the
bow and arrow, and fish are also caught by shooting
them with arrows.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Chaco Indian is the owner of a breed of dogs,
and large packs of these animals may be seen around
his camping-ground, or following the cavalcade in its
removal from place to place. They are small creatures,—supposed
to be derived from a European stock, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>they are wonderfully prolific, the female often bringing
forth twelve puppies at a birth. They burrow in the
ground, and subsist on the offal of the camp. They are
used in running down the spotted roebuck, in hunting
the capivara, the great ant-bear, <i>viscachas</i>, and other
small animals. The tapir is taken in traps, and also
speared, when the opportunity offers. His flesh is relished
by the Chaco Indian, but his hide is of more
consequence, as from it bags, whips, and various other
articles can be manufactured. The peccary of two species
(<i>dicotyles torquatus</i> and <i>collaris</i>) is also pursued by
the dogs, and speared by the hunter while pausing to
bay the yelping pack; and the great American tiger
(jaguar) is killed in a like manner. The slaying of this
fierce and powerful quadruped is one of the feats of the
Chaco hunter, and both its skin and flesh are articles of
eager demand. The latter is particularly sought for;
as by eating the flesh of so strong and courageous a
creature the Indian fancies his own strength and courage
will be increased. When a jaguar is killed, its carcass
becomes the common property of all; and each individual
of the tribe must have his slice, or “griskin,”—however
small the piece may be after such multiplied
subdivision! For the same reason, the flesh of the wild
boar is relished; also that of the ant-bear—one of the
most courageous of animals,—and of the tapir, on account
of its great strength.</p>

<p class='c016'>The bread of the Chaco Indian is derived, as before
mentioned, from several species of mimosæ, called indefinitely
<i>algarobias</i>, and by the missionary monks
known as “St. John’s bread.” Palms of various kinds
furnish edible nuts; and there are many trees in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Chaco forests that produce luscious fruits. With these
the Indian varies his diet, and also with wild honey,—a
most important article, for reasons already assigned.
In the Chaco there are stingless bees, of numerous distinct
species,—a proof of the many blossoms which
bloom as it were “unseen” in that flowery Elysium.
The honey of these bees—of some of the species in
particular—is known to be of the finest and purest
quality. In the Spanish settlements it commands the
highest price, and is very difficult to be obtained,—for
the Chaco Indian is but little given to commerce, and
only occasionally brings it to market. He has but few
wants to satisfy, and cares not for the tinsel of the trader:
hence it is that most of the honey he gathers is
reserved for his own use. He searches for the bees’
nest by observing the flight of the insect, as it passes
back and forward over the wild parterre; and his keenness
of sight—far surpassing that of a European—enables
him to trace its movements in the air, and follow
it to its hoard. He alleges that he could not accomplish
this so well, were he encumbered with eyebrows and
lashes, and offers this as one of his reasons for extracting
these hirsute appendages. There may be something
in what he says,—strange as it sounds to the ear of one
who is <i>not</i> a bee-hunter. He finds the nest at length,—sometimes
in a hollow tree, sometimes upon a branch,—the
latter kind of nest being a large mass, of a substance
like blotting-paper, and hanging suspended from the
twigs. Sometimes he traces the insect to a subterranean
dwelling; but it must be remarked that all these are
different species of bees, that build their nests and construct
the cells of their honeycombs each in its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>favorite place, and according to its own fashion. The
bee-hunter cares not how—so long as he can find the
nest; though he would prefer being guided to one built
upon a species of thick octagonal cactus, known as the
habitat of the bee “tosimi.” This preference is caused
by the simple fact—that of all the honey in the Chaco,
that of the bee “tosimi” is the <i>sweetest</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is to be regretted that, with his many virtues, and
his fine opportunity of exercising them, the Chaco Indian
will not consent to remain in peace and good-will
with all men. It seems a necessity of his nature to
have an occasional shy at some enemy, whether white or
of his own complexion. But, indeed, it would be ridiculous
to censure him for this, since it appears also to be a
vice universal among mankind; for where is the tribe
or nation, savage or civilized, who does not practise it,
whenever it feels bold enough or strong enough to do
so? The Chaco Indian is not alone in his disregard
of the sixth commandment,—not the only being on
earth who too frequently goes forth to battle.</p>

<p class='c016'>He has two distinct kinds of enemies,—one of European,
the other of his own race,—almost of his own
kindred, you would say. But it must be remembered
that there are several distinct tribes dwelling in the
Chaco; who, although presenting a certain similitude,
are in many respects widely dissimilar; and, so far from
forming one nation, or living in harmonious alliance with
each other, are more frequently engaged in the most
deadly hostilities. Their wars are all conducted on
horseback,—all cavalry skirmishes,—the Chaco Indian
disdaining to touch the ground with his foot. Dismounted
he would feel himself vanquished,—as much
out of his element as a fish out of water!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>His war weapons are of a primitive kind; they are
the bow and lance, and a species of club, known in
Spanish phraselogy as the “macana.” This last weapon
is also found in the hands of several of the Amazonian
tribes, though differing slightly in its construction. The
“macana” of the Chaco Indian is a short, stout piece
of heavy iron-wood,—usually a species known as the
<i>quebracha</i>, or “axe-breaker,” which grows plentifully
throughout the Paraguayan countries. Numerous species
are termed “quebracha” in Spanish-American countries,
as there are numerous “iron-woods.” That of Paraguay,
like most others that have obtained this name, is
a species of ebony-wood, or lignum-vitæ,—in short, a
true <i>guaiacum</i>. The wood is hard, solid, and heavy
almost as metal; and therefore just the very stuff for
a war-club.</p>

<p class='c016'>The macana of the Chaco Indian is short,—not much
over two feet in length, and is used both for striking in
the hand and throwing to a distance. It is thicker, and
of course heavier, at both extremities; and the mode of
grasping it is round the narrow part in the middle. The
Indian youths, while training for war, practise throwing
the macana, as other people play at skittles or quoits.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>lazo</i> and <i>bolas</i> are both in the hands of the Chaco
tribes, but these contrivances are used sparingly, and
more for hunting than war. They rarely trouble themselves
with them on a real war expedition.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their chief weapons against an enemy are their long
lances,—for these are far the most effective arms for a
man mounted on horseback. Those of the Chaco Indian
are of enormous length, their shafts being often
fifteen feet from butt to barb. They use them also when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>mounting on horseback, in a fashion peculiar to themselves.
They mount by the right side, contrary to our
European mode; nor is there the slightest resemblance
in any other respect between the two fashions of getting
into the saddle. With the Chaco Indian there is no putting
toes into stirrups,—no tugging at the poor steed’s
withers,—no clinging or climbing into the seat. He
places the butt of his lance upon the ground, grasps it a
little above his head with the right hand, and then raising
his lithe body with an elastic spring, he drops like a
cat upon the spine of his well-trained steed. A word,—a
touch of his knee, or other well-understood signal,—and
the animal is off like an arrow.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the Chaco Indian goes to war against the whites,
his arms are those already described. He is not yet
initiated into the use of guns and gunpowder, though he
often experiences their deadly effects. Indeed, the wonder
is that he could have maintained his independence so
long, with such weapons opposed to him. Gunpowder
has often given cowards the victory over brave men;
but the Chaco Indian, even without gunpowder, has
managed somehow or other to preserve his freedom.</p>

<p class='c016'>When he makes an expedition against the white settlements,
he carries no shield or other defensive armor.
He did so at one period of his history; but experience
has taught him that these contrivances are of little use
against leaden bullets; and he has thrown them away,
taking them up again, however, when he goes to war
with enemies of his own kind.</p>

<p class='c016'>In attacking a settlement or village of the whites, one
of his favorite strategic plans is to set the houses on
fire; and in this he very often succeeds,—almost certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>when the thatch chances to be dry. His plan is
to project an arrow with a piece of blazing cotton fastened
near the head. For this purpose he uses the
strongest kind of bow, and lying upon his back, bends
it with his feet. By this means a much longer range is
obtained, and the aim is of little consequence, so long as
the arrow falls upon the roof of house.</p>

<p class='c016'>On going to war with a hostile tribe of his own kind
and color, he equips himself in a manner altogether different.
His face is then painted most frightfully, and in
the most hideous designs that his imagination can suggest,
while his body is almost entirely covered by a complete
suit of mail. The thick hide of the tapir furnishes him
with the materials for helmet, cuirass, cuisses, greaves,
everything,—and underneath is a lining of jaguar-skin.
Thus accoutred he is in little danger from the arrows of
the enemy, though he is also sadly encumbered in the
management of his horse; and were he upon a plundering
expedition against the whites, such an encumbrance
would certainly bring him to grief. He knows that very
well, and therefore he never goes in such guise upon any
foray that is directed towards the settlements.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Chaco Indian has now been at peace with his
eastern neighbors—both Spaniards and Portuguese—for
a considerable length of time; but he still keeps up
hostility with the settlements on the south,—those of
Cordova and San Luis,—and often returns from these
wretched provinces laden with booty. If he should
chance to bring away anything that is of no use to
him, or that may appear superfluous in his savage home,—a
harp or guitar, a piece of costly furniture, or even
a handsome horse,—he is not required to throw it away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>he knows that he can find purchasers on the other side
of the river,—among the Spanish merchants of Corrientes
or Paraguay, who are ready at any time to
become the receivers of the property stolen from their
kindred of the south!</p>

<p class='c016'>Such queer three-cornered dealings are also carried on
in the northern countries of Spanish America,—in the
provinces of Chihuahua, New Leon, and New Mexico.
They are there called “cosas de Mexico.” It appears
they are equally “cosas de Paraguay.”</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>BOSJESMEN, OR BUSHMEN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>Perhaps no race of people has more piqued the
curiosity of the civilized world than those little yellow
savages of South Africa, known as the <i>Bushmen</i>. From
the first hour in which European nations became acquainted
with their existence, a keen interest was excited
by the stories told of their peculiar character and
habits; and although they have been visited by many
travellers, and many descriptions have been given of
them, it is but truth to say, that the interest in them
has not yet abated, and the Bushmen of Africa are almost
as great a curiosity at this hour as they were
when Di Gama first doubled the Cape. Indeed, there
is no reason why this should not be, for the habits and
personal appearance of these savages are just now as they
were then, and our familiarity with them is not much
greater. Whatever has been added to our knowledge
of their character, has tended rather to increase than
diminish our curiosity.</p>

<p class='c016'>At first the tales related of them were supposed to be
filled with wilful exaggerations, and the early travellers
were accused of dealing too much in the marvellous.
This is a very common accusation brought against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>early travellers; and in some instances it is a just one.
But in regard to the accounts given of the Bushmen
and their habits there has been far less exaggeration
than might be supposed; and the more insight we obtain
into their peculiar customs and modes of subsistence,
the more do we become satisfied that almost everything
alleged of them is true. In fact, it would be difficult
for the most inventive genius to contrive a fanciful account,
that would be much more curious or interesting
than the real and <i>bonâ fide</i> truth that can be told about
this most peculiar people.</p>

<p class='c016'>Where do the Bushmen dwell? what is their country?
These are questions not so easily answered, as
in reality they are not supposed to possess any country
at all, any more than the wild animals amidst which
they roam, and upon whom they prey. There is no
Bushman’s country upon the map, though several spots
in Southern Africa have at times received this designation.
It is not possible, therefore, to delineate the
boundaries of their country, since it has no boundaries,
any more than that of the wandering Gypsies of Europe.</p>

<p class='c016'>If the Bushmen, however, have no country in the
proper sense of the word, they have a “range,” and one
of the most extensive character—since it covers the
whole southern portion of the African continent, from
the Cape of Good Hope to the twentieth degree of south
latitude, extending east and west from the country of the
Caffres to the Atlantic Ocean. Until lately it was believed
that the Bushman-range did not extend far to the
north of the Orange river; but this has proved an erroneous
idea. They have recently “turned up” in the
land of the Dammaras, and also in the great Kalahari
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>desert, hundreds of miles north from the Orange river
and it is not certain that they do not range still nearer to
the equatorial line—though it may be remarked that
the country in that direction does not favor the supposition,
not being of the peculiar nature of a Bushman’s
country. The Bushman requires a desert for his dwelling-place.
It is an absolute necessity of his nature, as
it is to the ostrich and many species of animals; and
north of the twentieth degree of latitude, South Africa
does not appear to be of this character. The heroic
Livingstone has dispelled the long-cherished illusion of
the Geography about the “<i>Great-sanded level</i>” of these
interior regions; and, instead, disclosed to the world a
fertile land, well watered, and covered with a profuse
and luxuriant vegetation. In such a land there will be
no Bushmen.</p>

<p class='c016'>The limits we have allowed them, however, are sufficiently
large,—fifteen degrees of latitude, and an equally
extensive range from east to west. It must not be supposed,
however, that they <i>populate</i> this vast territory.
On the contrary, they are only distributed over it <i>in
spots</i>, in little communities, that have no relationship or
connection with one another, but are separated by wide
intervals, sometimes of hundreds of miles in extent. It
is only in the desert tracts of South Africa that the
Bushmen exist,—in the karoos, and treeless, waterless
plains—among the barren ridges and rocky defiles—in
the ravines formed by the beds of dried-up rivers—in
situations so sterile, so remote, so wild and inhospitable
as to offer a home to no other human being save the
Bushman himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>If we state more particularly the localities where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>haunts of the Bushman are to be found, we may specify
the barren lands on both sides of the Orange River,—including
most of its head-waters, and down to its mouth,—and
also the Great Kalahari desert. Through all this
extensive region the <i>kraals</i> of the Bushmen may be
encountered. At one time they were common enough
within the limits of the Cape colony itself, and some
half-caste remnants still exist in the more remote districts;
but the cruel persecution of the <i>boers</i> has had the
effect of extirpating these unfortunate savages; and, like
the elephant, the ostrich, and the eland, the true wild
Bushman is now only to be met with beyond the frontiers
of the colony.</p>

<p class='c016'>About the origin of the Bushmen we can offer no
opinion. They are generally considered as a branch
of the great Hottentot family; but this theory is far
from being an established fact. When South Africa
was first discovered and colonized, both Hottentots and
Bushmen were found there, differing from each other
just as they differ at this day; and though there are
some striking points of resemblance between them, there
are also points of dissimilarity that are equally as striking,
if we regard the two people as one. In personal
appearance there is a certain general likeness: that is,
both are woolly-haired, and both have a Chinese cast
of features, especially in the form and expression of the
eye. Their color too is nearly the same; but, on the other
hand, the Hottentots are larger than the Bushmen. It
is not in their persons, however, that the most essential
points of dissimilarity are to be looked for, but rather in
their mental characters; and here we observe distinctions
so marked and antithetical, that it is difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>reconcile them with the fact that these two people are
of one race. Whether a different habit of life has produced
this distinctive character, or whether <i>it</i> has influenced
the habits of life, are questions not easily answered.
We only know that a strange anomaly exists—the
anomaly of two people being personally alike—that
is, possessing physical characteristics that seem to
prove them of the same race, while intellectually, as we
shall presently see, they have scarce one character in
common. The slight resemblance that exists between
the languages of the two is not to be regarded as a proof
of their common origin. It only shows that they have
long lived in juxtaposition, or contiguous to each other;
a fact which cannot be denied.</p>

<p class='c016'>In giving a more particular description of the Bushman,
it will be seen in what respect he resembles the
true Hottentot, and in what he differs from him, both
physically and mentally, and this description may now
be given.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Bushman is the smallest man with whom we are
acquainted; and if the terms “dwarf” and “pigmy” may
be applied to any race of human beings, the South-African
Bushmen presents the fairest claim to these titles.
He stands only 4 feet 6 inches upon his naked soles—never
more than 4 feet 9, and not unfrequently is he
encountered of still less height—even so diminutive as
4 feet 2. His wife is of still shorter stature, and this
Lilliputian lady is often the mother of children when the
crown of her head is just 3 feet 9 inches above the soles
of her feet. It has been a very common thing to contradict
the assertion that these people are such pigmies
in stature, and even Dr. Livingstone has done so in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>late magnificent work. The doctor states, very jocosely,
that they are “not dwarfish—that the specimens brought
to Europe have been selected, like costermongers’ dogs,
for their extreme ugliness.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But the doctor forgets that it is not from “the specimens
brought to Europe” that the above standard of the
Bushman’s height has been derived, but from the testimony
of numerous travellers—many of them as trustworthy
as the doctor himself—from actual measurements
made by them upon the spot. It is hardly to be believed
that such men as Sparmann and Burchell, Barrow and
Lichtenstein, Harris, Campbell, Patterson, and a dozen
others that might be mentioned, should all give an erroneous
testimony on this subject. These travellers have
differed notoriously on other points, but in this they all
agree, that a Bushman of five feet in height is a <i>tall</i> man
in his tribe. Dr. Livingstone speaks of Bushmen “six
feet high,” and these are the tribes lately discovered living
so far north as the Lake Nagami. It is doubtful
whether these are Bushmen at all. Indeed, the description
given by the doctor, not only of their height and the
color of their skin, but also some hints about their intellectual
character, would lead to the belief that he has
mistaken some other people for Bushmen. It must be
remembered that the experience of this great traveller
has been chiefly among the <i>Bechuana</i> tribes, and his
knowledge of the Bushman proper does not appear to
be either accurate or extensive. No man is expected to
know everybody; and amid the profusion of new facts,
which the doctor has so liberally laid before the world,
it would be strange if a few inaccuracies should not
occur. Perhaps we should have more confidence if this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>was the only one we are enabled to detect; but the doctor
also denies that there is anything either terrific or
majestic in the “roaring of the lion.” Thus speaks he:
“The same feeling which has induced the modern painter
to caricature the lion has led the sentimentalist to consider
the lion’s roar as the most terrific of all earthly
sounds. We hear of the ‘majestic roar of the king of
beasts.’ To talk of the majestic roar of the lion is mere
majestic twaddle.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The doctor is certainly in error here. Does he suppose
that any one is ignorant of the character of the
lion’s roar? Does he fancy that no one has ever heard
it but himself? If it be necessary to go to South Africa
to take the true measure of a Bushman, it is not necessary
to make that long journey in order to obtain a correct
idea of the compass of the lion’s voice. We can
hear it at home in all its modulations; and any one who
has ever visited the Zoölogical Gardens in Regent’s
Park—nay, any one who chances to live within half a
mile of that magnificent menagerie—will be very much
disposed to doubt the correctness of the doctor’s assertion.
If there be a sound upon the earth above all
others “majestic,” a noise above all others “terrific,” it
is certainly the <i>roar</i> of the lion. Ask Albert Terrace
and St. John’s Wood!</p>

<p class='c016'>But let us not be too severe upon the doctor. The
World is indebted to him much more than to any other
modern traveller, and all great men indulge occasionally
in the luxury of an eccentric opinion. We have
brought the point forward here for a special purpose,—to
illustrate a too much neglected truth. Error is not
always on the side of exaggeration; but is sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>also found in the opposite extreme of a too-squeamish
moderation. We find the learned Professor Lichtenstein
ridiculing poor old Hernandez, the natural historian of
Mexico, for having given a description of certain fabulous
animals—<i>fabulous</i>, he terms them, because to him
they were odd and unknown. But it turns out that the
old author was right, and the <i>animals exist</i>! How
many similar misconceptions might be recorded of the
Buffons, and other closet philosophers—urged, too, with
the most bitter zeal! Incredulity carried too far is but
another form of credulity.</p>

<p class='c016'>But to return to our proper theme, and complete the
portrait of the Bushman. We have given his height.
It is in tolerable proportion to his other dimensions.
When young, he appears stout enough; but this is only
when a mere boy. At the age of sixteen he has reached
all the manhood he is ever destined to attain; and then
his flesh disappears; his body assumes a meagre outline;
his arms and limbs grow thin; the calf disappears from
his legs; the plumpness from his cheeks; and altogether
he becomes as wretched-looking an object as it is possible
to conceive in human shape. Older, his skin grows
dry, corrugated, and scaly; his bones protrude; and his
knee, elbow, and ankle-joints appear like horny knobs
placed at the ends of what more resemble long straight
sticks than the arms and limbs of a human being.</p>

<p class='c016'>The color of this creature may be designated a yellow-brown,
though it is not easy to determine it to a shade.
The Bushman appears darker than he really is; since
his skin serves him for a towel, and every species of
dirt that discommodes his fingers he gets rid of by wiping
it off on his arms, sides, or breast. The result is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that his whole body is usually coated over with a stratum
of grease and filth, which has led to the belief that he
regularly anoints himself—a custom common among
many savage tribes. This, however, the Bushman does
not do: the smearing toilet is merely occasional or accidental,
and consists simply in the fat of whatever flesh
he has been eating being transferred from his fingers to
the cuticle of his body. This is never washed off again—for
water never touches the Bushman’s hide. Such a
use of water is entirely unknown to him, not even for
washing his face. Should he have occasion to cleanse
his hands—which the handling of gum or some like
substance sometimes compels him to do—he performs
the operation, not with soap and water, but with the dry
dung of cattle or some wild animal. A little rubbing of
this upon his skin is all the purification the Bushman
believes to be needed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course, the dirt darkens his complexion; but he
has the vanity at times to brighten it up—not by
making it whiter—but rather a brick-red. A little
ochreous earth produces the color he requires; and with
this he smears his body all over—not excepting even
the crown of his head, and the scant stock of wool that
covers it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bushmen have been washed. It requires some scrubbing,
and a plentiful application either of soda or soap,
to reach the true skin and bring out the natural color;
but the experiment has been made, and the result proves
that the Bushman is not so black as, under ordinary circumstances,
he appears. A yellow hue shines through
the epidermis, somewhat like the color of the Chinese,
or a European in the worst stage of jaundice—the eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>only not having that complexion. Indeed, the features
of the Bushman, as well as the Hottentot, bear a strong
similarity to those of the Chinese, and the Bushman’s
eye is essentially of the Mongolian type. His hair,
however, is entirely of another character. Instead of
being long, straight, and lank, it is short, crisp, and
curly,—in reality, wool. Its scantiness is a characteristic;
and in this respect the Bushman differs from the
woolly-haired tribes both of Africa and Australasia.
These generally have “fleeces” in profusion, whereas
both Hottentot and Bushman have not enough to half
cover their scalps; and between the little knot-like
“kinks” there are wide spaces without a single hair
upon them. The Bushman’s “wool” is naturally black,
but red ochre and the sun soon convert the color into a
burnt reddish hue.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Bushman has no beard or other hairy encumbrances.
Were they to grow, he would root them out
as useless inconveniences. He has a low-bridged nose,
with wide flattened nostrils; an eye that appears a mere
slit between the eyelids; a pair of high cheek-bones,
and a receding forehead. His lips are not thick, as in
the negro, and he is furnished with a set of fine white
teeth, which, as he grows older, do not decay, but present
the singular phenomenon of being regularly worn
down to the stumps—as occurs to the teeth of sheep
and other ruminant animals.</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding the small stature of the Bushman,
his frame is wiry and capable of great endurance. He
is also as agile as an antelope.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the description above given, it will be inferred
that the Bushman is no beauty. Neither is the Bushwoman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>but, on the contrary, both having passed the
period of youth, become absolutely ugly,—the woman,
if possible, more so than the man.</p>

<p class='c016'>And yet, strange to say, many of the Bush-girls, when
young, have a cast of prettiness almost amounting to
beauty. It is difficult to tell in what this beauty consists.
Something, perhaps, in the expression of the
oblique almond-shaped eye, and the small well-formed
mouth and lips, with the shining white teeth. Their
limbs, too, at this early age, are often well rounded;
and many of them exhibit forms that might serve as
models for a sculptor. Their feet are especially well shaped,
and, in point of size, they are by far the smallest
in the world. Had the Chinese ladies been gifted
by nature with such little feet, they might have been
spared the torture of compressing them.</p>

<p class='c016'>The foot of a Bushwoman rarely measures so much
as six inches in length; and full-grown girls have been
seen, whose feet, submitted to the test of an actual
measurement, proved but a very little over four inches!</p>

<p class='c016'>Intellectually, the Bushman does not rank so low as
is generally believed. He has a quick, cheerful mind,
that appears ever on the alert,—as may be judged by
the constant play of his little piercing black eye,—and
though he does not always display much skill in
the manufacture of his weapons, he can do so if he
pleases. Some tribes construct their bows, arrows, fish-baskets,
and other implements and utensils with admirable
ingenuity; but in general the Bushman takes no
pride in fancy weapons. He prefers having them effective,
and to this end he gives proof of his skill in the
manufacture of most deadly poisons with which to anoint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>his arrows. Furthermore, he is ever active and ready
for action; and in this his mind is in complete contrast
with that of the Hottentot, with whom indolence is a
predominant and well-marked characteristic. The Bushman,
on the contrary, is always on the <i>qui vive</i>; always
ready to be doing where there is anything to do; and
there is not much opportunity for him to be idle, as he
rarely ever knows where the next meal is to come from.
The ingenuity which he displays in the capture of various
kinds of game,—far exceeding that of other hunting
tribes of Africa,—as also the cunning exhibited by him
while engaged in cattle-stealing and other plundering
forays, prove an intellectual capacity more than proportioned
to his diminutive body; and, in short, in
nearly every mental characteristic does he differ from
the supposed cognate race—the Hottentot.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would be hardly just to give the Bushman a character
for high courage; but, on the other hand, it would
be as unjust to charge him with cowardice. Small as
he is, he shows plenty of “pluck,” and when brought to
bay, his motto is, “No surrender.” He will fight to
the death, discharging his poisoned arrows as long as
he is able to bend a bow. Indeed, he has generally
been treated to shooting, or clubbing to death, wherever
and whenever caught, and he knows nothing of
<i>quarter</i>. Just as a badger he ends his life,—his last
struggle being an attempt to do injury to his assailant.
Tins trait in his character has, no doubt, been strengthened
by the inhuman treatment that, for a century, he
has been receiving from the brutal boers of the colonial
frontier.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/092.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c020'>The costume of the Bushman is of the most primitive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>character,—differing only from that worn by our first
parents, in that the fig-leaf used by the men is a patch
of jackal-skin, and that of the women a sort of fringe or
bunch of leather thongs, suspended around the waist by
a strap, and hanging down to the knees. It is in reality
a little apron of dressed skin; or, to speak more accurately,
two of them, one above the other, both cut into
narrow strips or thongs, from below the waist downward.
Other clothing than this they have none, if we except a
little skin <i>kaross</i>, or cloak, which is worn over their
shoulders;—that of the women being provided with a bag
or hood at the top, that answers the naked “piccaninny”
for a nest or cradle. Sandals protect their feet from the
sharp stones, and these are of the rudest description,—merely
a piece of the thick hide cut a little longer and
broader than the soles of the feet, and fastened at the
toes and round the ankles by thongs of sinews. An
attempt at ornament is displayed in a leathern skull-cap,
or more commonly a circlet around the head, upon which
are sewed a number of “cowries,” or small shells of the
<i>Cyprea moneta</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is difficult to say where these shells are procured,—as
they are not the product of the Bushman’s country,
but are only found on the far shores of the Indian Ocean.
Most probably he obtains them by barter, and after they
have passed through many hands; but they must cost
the Bushman dear, as he sets the highest value upon
them. Other ornaments consist of old brass or copper
buttons, attached to the little curls of his woolly hair;
and, among the women, strings of little pieces of ostrich
egg-shells, fashioned to resemble beads; besides a perfect
load of leathern bracelets on the arms, and a like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>profusion of similar circlets on the limbs, often reaching
from the knee to the ankle-joint.</p>

<p class='c016'>Red ochre over the face and hair is the fashionable
toilette, and a perfumery is obtained by rubbing the
skin with the powdered leaves of the “buku” plant,
a species of <i>diosma</i>. According to a quaint old writer,
this causes them to “stink like a poppy,” and would be
highly objectionable, were it not preferable to the odor
which they have without it.</p>

<p class='c016'>They do not <i>tattoo</i>, nor yet perforate the ears, lips, or
nose,—practices so common among savage tribes. Some
instances of nose-piercing have been observed, with the
usual appendage of a piece of wood or porcupine’s quill
inserted in the septum, but this is a custom rather of the
Caffres than Bushmen. Among the latter it is rare. A
grand ornament is obtained by smearing the face and
head with a shining micaceous paste, which is procured
from a cave in one particular part of the Bushman’s
range; but this, being a “far-fetched” article, is proportionably
scarce and dear. It is only a fine belle who
can afford to give herself a coat of <i>blink-slip</i>,—as this
sparkling pigment is called by the colonists. Many of
the women, and men as well, carry in their hands the
bushy tail of a jackal. The purpose is to fan off the
flies, and serve also as a “wipe,” to disembarrass their
bodies of perspiration when the weather chances to be
over hot.</p>

<p class='c016'>The domicile of the Bushman next merits description.
It is quite as simple and primitive as his dress, and
gives him about equal trouble in its construction. If
a cave or cleft can be found in the rocks, of sufficient
capacity to admit his own body and those of his family—never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>a very large one—he builds no house. The
cave contents him, be it ever so tight a squeeze. If
there be no cave handy, an overhanging rock will answer
equally as well. He regards not the open sides,
nor the draughts. It is only the rain which he does not
relish; and any sort of a shed, that will shelter him from
that, will serve him for a dwelling. If neither cave,
crevice, nor impending cliff can be found in the neighborhood,
he then resorts to the alternative of house-building;
and his style of architecture does not differ
greatly from that of the orang-outang. A bush is chosen
that grows near to two or three others,—the branches
of all meeting in a common centre. Of these branches
the builder takes advantage, fastening them together at
the ends, and wattling some into the others. Over this
framework a quantity of grass is scattered in such a
fashion as to cast off a good shower of rain, and then the
“carcass” of the building is considered complete. The
inside work remains yet to be done, and that is next set
about. A large roundish or oblong hole is scraped out
in the middle of the floor. It is made wide enough and
deep enough to hold the bodies of three or four Bush-people,
though a single large Caffre or Dutchman would
scarcely find room in it. Into this hole is flung a
quantity of dry grass, and arranged so as to present the
appearance of a gigantic nest. This nest, or lair, becomes
the bed of the Bushman, his wife, or wives,—for
he frequently keeps two,—and the other members of
his family. Coiled together like monkeys, and covered
with their skin karosses, they all sleep in it,—whether
“sweetly” or “soundly,” I shall not take upon me to
determine.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>It is supposed to be this fashion of literally “sleeping
in the bush,” as also the mode by which he skulks and
hides among bushes,—invariably taking to them when
pursued,—that has given origin to the name Bushman,
or <i>Bosjesman</i>, as it is in the language of the colonial
Dutch. This derivation is probable enough, and no
better has been offered.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Bushman sometimes constructs himself a more
elaborate dwelling; that is, some Bushmen;—for it
should be remarked that there are a great many
tribes or communities of these people, and they are not
all so very low in the scale of civilization. None, however,
ever arrive at the building of a house,—not even
a hut. A tent is their highest effort in the building
line, and that is of the rudest description, scarce deserving
the name. Its covering is a mat, which they weave
out of a species of rush that grows along some of the
desert streams; and in the fabrication of the covering
they display far more ingenuity than in the planning or
construction of the tent itself. The mat, in fact, is
simply laid over two poles, that are bent into the form
of an arch, by having both ends stuck into the ground.
A second piece of matting closes up one end; and the
other, left open, serves for the entrance. As a door is
not deemed necessary, no further construction is required,
and the tent is “pitched” complete. It only
remains to scoop out the sand, and make the <i>nest</i> as
already described.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is said that the Goths drew their ideas of architecture
from the aisles of the oak forest; the Chinese
from their Mongolian tents; and the Egyptians from
their caves in the rocks. Beyond a doubt, the Bushman
has borrowed his from the nest of the ostrich!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>It now becomes necessary to inquire how the Bushman
spends his time? how he obtains subsistence? and
what is the nature of his food? All these questions can
be answered, though at first it may appear difficult to
answer them. Dwelling, as he always does, in the very
heart of the desert, remote from forests that might furnish
him with some sort of food—trees that might yield
fruit,—far away from a fertile soil, with no knowledge
of agriculture, even if it were near,—with no flocks or
herds; neither sheep, cattle, horses, nor swine,—no
domestic animals but his lean, diminutive dogs,—how
does this Bushman procure enough to eat? What are
his sources of supply?</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall see. Being neither a grazier nor a farmer,
he has other means of subsistence,—though it must be
confessed that they are of a precarious character, and
often during his life does the Bushman find himself on
the very threshold of starvation. This, however, results
less from the parsimony of Nature than the Bushman’s
own improvident habits,—a trait in his character which
is, perhaps, more strongly developed in him than any
other. We shall have occasion to refer to it presently.</p>

<p class='c016'>His first and chief mode of procuring his food is by
the chase: for, although he is surrounded by the sterile
wilderness, he is not the only animated being who has
chosen the desert for his home. Several species of
birds—one the largest of all—and quadrupeds, share
with the Bushman the solitude and safety of this desolate
region. The rhinoceros can dwell there; and in
numerous streams are found the huge hippopotami;
whilst quaggas, zebras, and several species of antelope
frequent the desert plains as their favorite “stamping”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>ground. Some of these animals can live almost without
water; but when they do require it, what to them is a
gallop of fifty miles to some well-known “vley” or pool?
It will be seen, therefore, that the desert has its numerous
denizens. All these are objects of the Bushman’s
pursuit, who follows them with incessant pertinacity—as
if he were a beast of prey, furnished by Nature with
the most carnivorous propensities.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the capture of these animals he displays an almost
incredible dexterity and cunning. His mode of approaching
the sly ostrich, by disguising himself in the
skin of one of these birds, is so well known that I need
not describe it here; but the <i>ruses</i> he adopts for capturing
or killing other sorts of game are many of them
equally ingenious. The pit-trap is one of his favorite
contrivances; and this, too, has been often described,—but
often very erroneously. The pit is not a large
hollow,—as is usually asserted,—but rather of dimensions
proportioned to the size of the animal that is expected
to fall into it. For game like the rhinoceros or
<i>eland</i> antelope, it is dug of six feet in length and three
in width at the top; gradually narrowing to the bottom,
where it ends in a trench of only twelve inches broad.
Six or seven feet is considered deep enough; and the
animal, once into it, gets so wedged at the narrow bottom
part as to be unable to make use of its legs for the
purpose of springing out again. Sometimes a sharp
stake or two are used, with the view of <i>impaling</i> the
victim; but this plan is not always adopted. There is
not much danger of a quadruped that drops in ever
getting out again, till he is dragged out by the Bushman
in the shape of a carcass.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The Bushman’s ingenuity does not end here. Besides
the construction of the trap, it is necessary the
game should be guided into it. Were this not done, the
pit might remain a long time empty, and, as a necessary
consequence, so too might the belly of the Bushman.
In the wide plain few of the gregarious animals have a
path which they follow habitually; only where there is
a pool may such beaten trails be found, and of these the
Bushman also avails himself; but they are not enough.
Some artificial means must be used to make the traps
pay—for they are not constructed without much labor
and patience. The plan adopted by the Bushman to
accomplish this exhibits some points of originality. He
first chooses a part of the plain which lies between two
mountains. No matter if these be distant from each
other: a mile, or even two, will not deter the Bushman
from his design. By the help of his whole tribe—men,
women, and children—he constructs a fence from one
mountain to the other. The material used is whatever
may be most ready to the hand: stones, sods, brush, or
dead timber, if this be convenient. No matter how
rude the fence: it need not either be very high. He
leaves several gaps in it; and the wild animals, however
easily they might leap over such a puny barrier, will,
in their ordinary way, prefer to walk leisurely through
the gaps. In each of these, however, there is a dangerous
hole—dangerous from its depth as well as from the
cunning way in which it is concealed from the view—in
short, in each gap there is a <i>pit-fall</i>. No one—at
least no animal except the elephant—would ever suspect
its presence; the grass seems to grow over it, and
the sand lies unturned, just as elsewhere upon the plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>What quadruped could detect the cheat? Not any one
except the sagacious elephant. The stupid eland tumbles
through; the gemsbok goes under; and the rhinoceros
rushes into it as if destined to destruction. The
Bushman sees this from his elevated perch, glides forward
over the ground, and spears the struggling victim
with his <i>poisoned assagai</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides the above method of capturing game the
Bushman also uses the bow and arrows. This is a
weapon in which he is greatly skilled; and although
both bow and arrows are as tiny as if intended for
children’s toys, they are among the deadliest of weapons,
their fatal effect lies not in the <i>size</i> of the wound they
are capable of inflicting, but in the peculiar mode in
which the barbs of the arrows are prepared. I need
hardly add that they are dipped in poison;—for who
has not heard of the poisoned arrows of the African
Bushmen?</p>

<p class='c016'>Both bow and arrows are usually rude enough in
their construction, and would appear but a trumpery
affair, were it not for a knowledge of their effects. The
bow is a mere round stick, about three feet long, and
slightly bent by means of its string of twisted sinews.
The arrows are mere reeds, tipped with pieces of bone,
with a split ostrich-quill lapped behind the head, and
answering for a barb. This arrow the Bushman can
shoot with tolerable certainty to a distance of a hundred
yards, and he can even project it farther by giving a
slight elevation to his aim. It signifies not whether the
force with which it strikes the object be ever so slight,
if it only makes an entrance. Even a scratch from its
point will sometimes prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Of course the danger dwells altogether in the poison.
Were it not for that, the Bushman, from his dwarfish
stature and pigmy strength, would be a harmless
creature indeed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The poison he well knows how to prepare, and he
can make it of the most “potent spell,” when the “materials”
are within his reach. For this purpose he
makes use of both vegetable and animal substances, and
a mineral is also employed; but the last is not a poison,
and is only used to give consistency to the liquid, so that
it may the better adhere to the arrow. The vegetable
substances are of various kinds. Some are botanically
known: the bulb of <i>Amaryllis disticha</i>,—the gum of a
<i>Euphorbia</i>,—the sap of a species of sumac (<i>Rhus</i>),—and
the nuts of a shrubby plant, by the colonists called
<i>Woolf-gift</i> (Wolf-poison).</p>

<p class='c016'>The animal substance is the fluid found in the fangs
of venomous serpents, several species of which serve the
purpose of the Bushman: as the little “Horned Snake,”—so
called from the scales rising prominently over its
eyes; the “Yellow Snake,” or South-African Cobra
(<i>Naga haje</i>); the “Puff Adder,” and others. From all
these he obtains the ingredients of his deadly ointment,
and mixes them, not all together; for he cannot always
procure them all in any one region of the country in
which he dwells. He makes his poison, also, of different
degrees of potency, according to the purpose for which
he intends it; whether for hunting or war. With sixty
or seventy little arrows, well imbued with this fatal
mixture, and carefully placed in his quiver of tree-bark
or skin,—or, what is not uncommon, stuck like a coronet
around his head,—he sallies forth, ready to deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>destruction either to game, animals, or of human enemies.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of these last he has no lack. Every man, not a
Bushman, he deems his enemy; and he has some reason
for thinking so. Truly may it be said of him, as of
Ishmael, that his “hand is against every man, and every
man’s hand against him;” and such has been his unhappy
history for ages. Not alone have the boers been
his pursuers and oppressors, but all others upon his
borders who are strong enough to attack him,—colonists,
Caffres, and Bechuanas, all alike,—not even excepting
his supposed kindred, the Hottentots. Not only
does no fellow-feeling exist between Bushman and Hottentot,
but, strange to say, they hate each other with the
most rancorous hatred. The Bushman will plunder a
Namaqua Hottentot, a Griqua, or a Gonaqua,—plunder
and murder him with as much ruthlessness, or even
more, than he would the hated Caffre or boer. All are
alike his enemies,—all to be plundered and massacred,
whenever met, and the thing appears possible.</p>

<p class='c016'>We are speaking of plunder. This is another source
of supply to the Bushman, though one that is not always
to be depended upon. It is his most dangerous method
of obtaining a livelihood, and often costs him his life.
He only resorts to it when all other resources fail him,
and food is no longer to be obtained by the chase.</p>

<p class='c016'>He makes an expedition into the settlements,—either
of the frontier boers, Caffres, or Hottentots,—whichever
chance to live most convenient to his haunts. The expedition,
of course, is by night, and conducted, not as an
open <i>foray</i> but in secret, and by stealth. The cattle are
stolen, not <i>reeved</i>, and driven off while the owner and his
people are asleep.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>In the morning, or as soon as the loss is discovered,
a pursuit is at once set on foot. A dozen men, mounted
and armed with long muskets (<i>röers</i>), take the <i>spoor</i> of
the spoilers, and follow it as fast as their horses will
carry them. A dozen boers, or even half that number,
is considered a match for a whole tribe of Bushmen, in
any fight which may occur in the open plain, as the
boers make use of their long-range guns at such a distance
that the Bushmen are shot down without being
able to use their poisoned arrows; and if the thieves
have the fortune to be overtaken before they have got
far into the desert, they stand a good chance of being
terribly chastised.</p>

<p class='c016'>There is no quarter shown them. Such a thing as
mercy is never dreamt of,—no sparing of lives any
more than if they were a pack of hyenas. The Bushmen
may escape to the rocks, such of them as are not
hit by the bullets; and there the boers know it would be
idle to follow them. Like the klipspringer antelope, the
little savages can bound from rock to rock, and cliff
to cliff, or hide like partridges among crevices, where
neither man nor horse can pursue them. Even upon
the level plain—if it chance to be stony or intersected
with breaks and ravines—a horseman would endeavor
to overtake them in vain, for these yellow imps are as
swift as ostriches.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the spoilers scatter thus, the boer may recover
his cattle, but in what condition? That he has surmised
already, without going among the herd. He does
not expect to drive home one half of them; perhaps not
one head. On reaching the flock he finds there is not
one without a wound of some kind or other: a gash in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the flank, the cut of a knife, the stab of an assagai, or a
poisoned arrow—intended for the boer himself—sticking
between the ribs. This is the sad spectacle that
meets his eyes; but he never reflects that it is the result
of his own cruelty,—he never regards it in the light of
retribution. Had he not first hunted the Bushman to
make him a slave, to make bondsmen and bondsmaids
of his sons and daughters, to submit them to the caprice
and tyranny of his great, strapping <i>frau</i>, perhaps
his cattle would have been browsing quietly in his fields.
The poor Bushman, in attempting to take them, followed
but his instincts of hunger: in yielding them up he
obeyed but the promptings of revenge.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not always that the Bushman is thus overtaken.
He frequently succeeds in carrying the whole herd to
his desert fastness; and the skill which he exhibits in
getting them there is perfectly surprising. The cattle
themselves are more afraid of him than of a wild beast,
and run at his approach; but the Bushman, swifter than
they, can glide all around them, and keep them moving
at a rapid rate.</p>

<p class='c016'>He uses stratagem also to obstruct or baffle the pursuit.
The route he takes is through the driest part of
the desert,—if possible, where water does not exist at
all. The cattle suffer from thirst, and bellow from the
pain; but the Bushman cares not for that, so long as he
is himself served. But how is he served? There is no
water, and a Bushman can no more go without drinking
than a boer: how then does he provide for himself
on these long expeditions?</p>

<p class='c016'>All has been pre-arranged. While off to the settlements,
the Bushman’s wife has been busy. The whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span><i>kraal</i> of women—young and old—have made an excursion
half-way across the desert, each carrying ostrich
egg-shells, as much as her kaross will hold, each shell
full of water. These have been deposited at intervals
along the route in secret spots known by marks to the
Bushmen, and this accomplished the women return home
again. In this way the plunderer obtains his supply of
water, and thus is he enabled to continue his journey
over the arid <i>Karroo</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The pursuers become appalled. They are suffering
from thirst—their horses sinking under them. Perhaps
they have lost their way? It would be madness to proceed
further. “Let the cattle go this time!” and with
this disheartening reflection they give up the pursuit,
turn the heads of their horses, and ride homeward.</p>

<p class='c016'>There is a feast at the Bushman’s kraal—and such a
feast! not <i>one</i> ox is slaughtered, but a score of them all
at once. They kill them, as if from very wantonness;
and they no longer eat, but raven on the flesh.</p>

<p class='c016'>For days the feasting is kept up almost continuously,—even
at night they must wake up to have a midnight
meal! and thus runs the tale, till every ox has been eaten.
They have not the slightest idea of a provision for the future;
even the lower animals seem wiser in this respect.
They do not think of keeping a few of the plundered
cattle at pasture to serve them for a subsequent occasion.
They give the poor brutes neither food nor drink; but
having penned them up in some defile of the rocks, leave
them to moan and bellow, to drop down and die.</p>

<p class='c016'>On goes the feasting, till all are finished; and even if
the flesh has turned putrid, this forms not the slightest
objection: it is eaten all the same.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The kraal now exhibits an altered spectacle. The
starved meagre wretches, who were seen flitting among
its tents but a week ago, have all disappeared. Plump
bodies and distended abdomens are the order of the day;
and the profile of the Bushwoman, taken from the neck
to the knees, now exhibits the outline of the letter S.
The little imps leap about, tearing raw flesh,—their
yellow cheeks besmeared with blood,—and the lean curs
seem to have been exchanged for a pack of fat, petted
poodles.</p>

<p class='c016'>But this scene must some time come to an end, and at
length it does end. All the flesh is exhausted, and the
bones picked clean. A complete reaction comes over the
spirit of the Bushman. He falls into a state of languor,—the
only time when he knows such a feeling,—and
he keeps his kraal, and remains idle for days. Often he
sleeps for twenty-four hours at a time, and wakes only
to go to sleep again. He need not rouse himself with the
idea of getting something to eat: there is not a morsel
in the whole kraal, and he knows it. He lies still, therefore,—weakened
with hunger, and overcome with the
drowsiness of a terrible lassitude.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fortunate for him, while in this state, if those bold
vultures—attracted by the <i>débris</i> of his feast, and now
high wheeling in the air—be not perceived from afar;
fortunate if they do not discover the whereabouts of his
kraal to the vengeful pursuer. If they should do so,
he has made his last foray and his last feast.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the absolute danger of starvation at length
compels our Bushman to bestir himself, he seems to
recover a little of his energy, and once more takes to
hunting, or, if near a stream, endeavors to catch a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>fish. Should both these resources fail, he has another,—without
which he would most certainly starve,—and
perhaps this may be considered his most important
source of supply, since it is the most constant, and can
be depended on at nearly all seasons of the year. Weakened
with hunger, then, and scarce equal to any severer
labor, he goes <i>out hunting—this time insects, not quadrupeds</i>.
With a stout stick inserted into a stone at one
end and pointed at the other, he proceeds to the nests
of the white ants (<i>termites</i>), and using the point of the
stick,—the stone serving by its weight to aid the force
of the blow,—he breaks open the hard, gummy clay of
which the hillock is formed. Unless the <i>aard-vark</i> and
the <i>pangolin</i>—two very different kinds of ant-eaters—have
been there before him, he finds the chambers filled
with the eggs of the ants, the insects themselves, and
perhaps large quantities of their <i>larvæ</i>. All are equally
secured by the Bushman, and either devoured on the
spot, or collected into a skin bag, and carried back to
his kraal.</p>

<p class='c016'>He hunts also another species of ants that do not build
nests or “hillocks,” but bring forth their young in hollows
under the ground. These make long galleries or
covered ways just under the surface, and at certain periods—which
the Bushman knows by unmistakable
signs—they become very active, and traverse these
underground galleries in thousands. If the passages
were to be opened above, the ants would soon make off to
their caves, and but a very few could be captured. The
Bushman, knowing this, adopts a stratagem. With the
stick already mentioned he pierces holes of a good depth
down; and works the stick about, until the sides of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>holes are smooth and even. These he intends shall serve
him as pitfalls; and they are therefore made in the covered
ways along which the insects are passing. The
result is, that the little creatures, not suspecting the existence
of these deep wells, tumble head foremost into
them, and are unable to mount up the steep smooth sides
again, so that in a few minutes the hole will be filled
with ants, which the Bushman scoops out at his leisure.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another source of supply which he has, and also a
pretty constant one, consists of various roots of the
tuberous kind, but more especially bulbous roots, which
grow in the desert. They are several species of <i>Ixias</i>
and <i>Mesembryanthemums</i>,—some of them producing
bulbs of a large size, and deeply buried underground.
Half the Bushman’s and Bushwoman’s time is occupied
in digging for these roots; and the spade employed is
the stone-headed staff already described.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ostrich eggs also furnish the Bushman with many a
meal; and the huge shells of these eggs serve him for
water-vessels, cups, and dishes. He is exceedingly expert
in tracking up the ostrich, and discovering its nest.
Sometimes he finds a nest in the absence of the birds;
and in a case of this kind he pursues a course of conduct
that is <i>peculiarly Bushman</i>. Having removed all
the eggs to a distance, and concealed them under some
bush, he returns to the nest and ensconces himself in it.
His diminutive body, when close squatted, cannot be
perceived from a distance, especially when there are a
few bushes around the nest, as there usually are. Thus
concealed he awaits the return of the birds, holding
his bow and poisoned arrows ready to salute them as
soon as they come within range. By this <i>ruse</i> he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>almost certain of killing either the cock or hen, and not
unfrequently both—when they do not return together.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lizards and land-tortoises often furnish the Bushman
with a meal; and the shell of the latter serves him also
for a dish; but his period of greatest plenty is when
the <i>locusts appear</i>. Then, indeed, the Bushman is no
longer in want of a meal; and while these creatures remain
with him, he knows no hunger. He grows fat in
a trice, and his curs keep pace with him—for they too
greedily devour the locusts. Were the locusts a constant,
or even an annual visitor, the Bushman would be
a rich man—at all events his wants would be amply
supplied. Unfortunately for him, but fortunately for
everybody else, these terrible destroyers of vegetation
only come now and then—several years often intervening
between their visits.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Bushmen have no religion whatever; no form
of marriage—any more than mating together like wild
beasts; but they appear to have some respect for the
memory of their dead, since they bury them—usually
erecting a large pile of stones, or “cairn,” over the
body.</p>

<p class='c016'>They are far from being of a melancholy mood.
Though crouching in their dens and caves during the
day, in dread of the boers and other enemies, they come
forth at night to chatter and make merry. During fine
moonlights they dance all night, keeping up the <i>ball</i> till
morning; and in their kraals may be seen a circular
spot—beaten hard and smooth with their feet—where
these dances are performed.</p>

<p class='c016'>They have no form of government—not so much as
a head man or chief. Even the father of the family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>possesses no authority, except such as superior strength
may give him; and when his sons are grown up and
become as strong as he is, this of course also ceases.</p>

<p class='c016'>They have no tribal organization; the small communities
in which they live being merely so many individuals
accidently brought together, often quarrelling
and separating from one another. These communities
rarely number over a hundred individuals, since, from
the nature of their country, a large number could not
find subsistence in any one place. It follows, therefore,
that the Bushman race must ever remain widely scattered—so
long as they pursue their present mode of
life—and no influence has ever been able to win them
from it. Missionary efforts made among them have all
proved fruitless. The desert seems to have been created
for them, as they for the desert; and when transferred
elsewhere, to dwell amidst scenes of civilized life,
they always yearn to return to their wilderness home.</p>

<p class='c016'>Truly are these pigmy savages an odd people!</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE AMAZONIAN INDIANS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>In glancing at the map of the American continent,
we are struck by a remarkable analogy between the
geographical features of its two great divisions—the
North and the South,—an analogy amounting almost
to a symmetrical parallelism.</p>

<p class='c016'>Each has its “mighty” mountains—the <i>Cordilleras
of the Andes</i> in the south, and the <i>Cordilleras of the
Sierra Madre</i> (Rocky Mountains) in the north—with
all the varieties of volcano and eternal snow. Each has
its secondary chain: in the north, the <i>Nevadas</i> of California
and Oregon; in the south, the <i>Sierras</i> of Caraccas
and the group of Guiana; and, if you wish to
render the parallelism complete, descend to a lower elevation,
and set the Alleghanies of the United States
against the mountains of Brazil—both alike detached
from all the others.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the comparison we have exhausted the mountain chains
of both divisions of the continent. If we proceed
further, and carry it into minute detail, we shall
find the same correspondence—ridge for ridge, chain
for chain, peak for peak;—in short, a most singular
equilibrium, as if there had been a design that one half
of this great continent should balance the other!</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>From the mountains let us proceed to the rivers,
and see how <i>they</i> will correspond. Here, again, we discover
a like parallelism, amounting almost to a rivalry.
Each continent (for it is proper to style them so) contains
the largest river in the world. If we make <i>length</i>
the standard, the north claims precedence for the Mississippi;
if <i>volume of water</i> is to be the criterion, the
south is entitled to it upon the merits of the Amazon.
Each, too, has its numerous branches, spreading into a
mighty “tree”; and these, either singly or combined,
form a curious equipoise both in length and magnitude.
We have only time to set list against list, tributaries of
the great northern river against tributaries of its great
southern compeer,—the Ohio and Illinois, the Yellowstone
and Platte, the Kansas and Osage, the Arkansas
and Red, against the Madeira and Purus, the Ucayali
and Huallaga, the Japura and Negro, the Xingu and
Tapajos.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of other river systems, the St. Lawrence may be
placed against the La Plata, the Oregon against the
Orinoco, the Mackenzie against the Magdalena, and
the Rio Bravo del Norte against the Tocantins; while
the two Colorados—the Brazos and Alabama—find
their respective rivals in the Essequibo, the Paranahybo,
the Pedro, and the Patagonian Negro; and the San
Francisco of California, flowing over sands of gold, is
balanced by its homonyme of Brazil, that has its origin
in the land of diamonds. To an endless list might the
comparison be carried.</p>

<p class='c016'>We pass to the plains. <i>Prairies</i> in the north, <i>llanos</i>
and <i>pampas</i> in the south, almost identical in character.
Of the <i>plateaux</i> or table-lands, those of Mexico, La
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Puebla, Perote, and silver Potosi in the north; those of
Quito, Bogota, Cusco, and gold Potosi in the south; of
the desert plains, Utah and the Llano Estacado against
Atacama and the deserts of Patagonia. Even the Great
Salt Lake has its parallel in Titicaca; while the “Salinas”
of New Mexico and the upland prairies, are represented
by similar deposits in the Gran Chaco and the
Pampas.</p>

<p class='c016'>We arrive finally at the forests. Though unlike in
other respects, we have here also a rivalry in magnitude,—between
the vast timbered expanse stretching
from Arkansas to the Atlantic shores, and that which
covers the valley of the Amazon. These <i>were</i> the two
greatest forests on the face of the earth. I say <i>were</i>, for
one of them no longer exists; at least, it is no longer a
continuous tract, but a collection of forests, opened by
the axe, and intersected by the clearings of the colonist.
The other still stands in all its virgin beauty and primeval
vigor, untouched by the axe, undefiled by fire, its
path scarce trodden by human feet, its silent depths to
this hour unexplored.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is with this forest and its denizens we have to do.
Here then let us terminate the catalogue of similitudes,
and concentrate our attention upon the particular subject
of our sketch.</p>

<p class='c016'>The whole <i>valley</i> of the Amazon—in other words,
the tract watered by this great river and its tributaries—may
be described as one unbroken forest. We now
know the borders of this forest with considerable exactness,
but to trace them here would require a too lengthened
detail. Suffice it to say, that lengthwise it extends
from the mouth of the Amazon to the foot-hills of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Peruvian Andes, a distance of 2,500 miles. In breadth
it varies, beginning on the Atlantic coast with a breadth
of 400 miles, which widens towards the central part of
the continent till it attains to 1,500, and again narrowing
to about 1,000, where it touches the eastern slope of the
Andes.</p>

<p class='c016'>That form of leaf known to botanists as “obovate”
will give a good idea of the figure of the great Amazon
forest, supposing the small end or shank to rest on the
Atlantic, and the broad end to extend along the semicircular
concavity of the Andes, from Bolivia on the
south to New Granada on the north. In all this vast
expanse of territory there is scarce an acre of open
ground, if we except the water-surface of the rivers and
their bordering “lagoons,” which, were they to bear
their due proportions on a map, could scarce be represented
by the narrowest lines, or the most inconspicuous
dots. The grass plains which embay the forest on its
southern edge along the banks of some of its Brazilian
tributaries, or those which proceed like spurs from the
Llanos of Venezuela, do not in any place approach the
Amazon itself, and there are many points on the great
river which may be taken as centres, and around which
circles may be drawn, having diameters 1,000 miles in
length, the circumferences of which will enclose nothing
but timbered land. The main stream of the Amazon,
though it intersects this grand forest, does not <i>bisect</i> it,
speaking with mathematical precision. There is rather
more timbered surface to the southward than that which
extends northward, though the inequality of the two
divisions is not great. It would not be much of an error
to say that the Amazon river cuts the forest in halves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>At its mouth, however, this would not apply: since for
the first 300 miles above the embouchure of the river
the country on the northern side is destitute of timber.
This is occasioned by the projecting spurs of the Guiana
mountains, which on that side approach the Amazon in
the shape of naked ridges and grass-covered hills and
plains.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not necessary to say that the great forest of the
Amazon is a tropical one—since the river itself, throughout
its whole course, almost traces the line of the equator.
Its vegetation, therefore, is emphatically of a tropical
character and in this respect it differs essentially from
that of North America, or rather, we should say, of Canada
and the United States. It is necessary to make this
limitation, because the forests of the tropical parts of
North America, including the West-Indian islands, present
a great similitude to that of the Amazon. It is not
only in the genera and species of trees that the <i>sylva</i> of
the temperate zone differs from that of the torrid; but
there is a very remarkable difference in the distribution
of these genera and species. In a great forest of the
north, it is not uncommon to find a large tract covered
with a single species of trees,—as with pines, oaks,
poplars, or the red cedar (<i>Juniperus Virginiana</i>). This
arrangement is rather the rule than the exception;
whereas, in the tropical forest, the rule is reversed, except
in the case of two or three species of palms (<i>Mauritia</i>
and <i>Euterpe</i>), which sometimes exclusively cover
large tracts of surface. Of other trees, it is rare to find
even a clump or grove standing together—often only
two or three trees, and still more frequently, a single
individual is observed, separated from those of its own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>kind by hundreds of others, all differing in order, genus,
and species. I note this peculiarity of the tropic forest,
because it exercises, as may easily be imagined, a direct
influence upon the economy of its human occupants—whether
these be savage or civilized. Even the habits
of the lower animals—beasts and birds—are subject to
a similar influence.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would be out of place here to enumerate the different
kinds of trees that compose this mighty wood,—a
bare catalogue of their names would alone fill many
pages,—and it would be safe to say that if the list were
given as now known to botanists, it would comprise
scarce half the species that actually exist in the valley
of the Amazon. In real truth, this vast Garden of God
is yet unexplored by man. Its border walks and edges
have alone been examined; and the enthusiastic botanist
need not fear that he is too late in the field. A hundred
years will elapse before this grand <i>parterre</i> can be exhausted.</p>

<p class='c016'>At present, a thorough examination of the botany of
the Amazon valley would be difficult, if not altogether
impossible, even though conducted on a grand and expensive
scale. There are several reasons for this. Its
woods are in many places absolutely impenetrable—on
account either of the thick tangled undergrowth, or from
the damp, spongy nature of the soil. There are no
roads that could be traversed by horse or man; and
the few paths are known only to the wild savage,—not
always passable even by him. Travelling can only be
done by water, either upon the great rivers, or by the
narrow creeks (igaripes) or lagoons; and a journey performed
in this fashion must needs be both tedious and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>indirect, allowing but a limited opportunity for observation.
Horses can scarce be said to exist in the country,
and cattle are equally rare—a few only are found in
one or two of the large Portuguese settlements on the
main river—and the jaguars and blood-sucking bats
offer a direct impediment to their increase. Contrary to
the general belief, the tropical forest is not the home of
the larger mammalia: it is not their proper <i>habitat</i>, nor
are they found in it. In the Amazon forest but few
species exist, and these not numerous in individuals.
There are no vast herds—as of buffaloes on the prairies
of North America, or of antelopes in Africa. The
tapir alone attains to any considerable size,—exceeding
that of the ass,—but its numbers are few. Three or
four species of small deer represent the ruminants, and
the hog of the Amazon is the peccary. Of these there
are at least three species. Where the forest impinges
on the mountain regions of Peru, bears are found of
at least two kinds, but not on the lower plains of the
great “Montaña,”—for by this general designation is
the vast expanse of the Amazon country known among
the Peruvian people. “Montes” and “montañas,” literally
signifying “mountains,” are not so understood
among Spanish Americans. With them the “montes”
and “montañas” are tracts of forest-covered country,
and that of the Amazon valley is the “Montaña” <i>par
excellence</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sloths of several species, and opossums of still greater
variety, are found all over the Montaña, but both thinly
distributed as regards the number of individuals. A
similar remark applies to the ant-eaters or “ant-bears,”
of which there are four kinds,—to the armadillos, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“agoutis,” and the “cavies,” one of which last, the <i>capibara</i>,
is the largest rodent upon earth. This, with its
kindred genus, the “paca,” is not so rare in individual
numbers, but, on the contrary, appears in large herds
upon the borders of the rivers and lagoons. A porcupine,
several species of spinous rats, an otter, two or
three kinds of badger-like animals (the <i>potto</i> and <i>coatis</i>),
a “honey-bear” (<i>Galera barbara</i>), and a fox, or wild
dog, are widely distributed throughout the Montaña.</p>

<p class='c016'>Everywhere exists the jaguar, both the black and
spotted varieties, and the puma has there his lurking-place.
Smaller cats, both spotted and striped, are numerous
in species, and squirrels of several kinds, with
bats, complete the list of the terrestrial mammalia.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of all the lower animals, monkeys are the most
common, for to them the Montaña is a congenial home.
They abound not only in species, but in the number
of individuals, and their ubiquitous presence contributes
to enliven the woods. At least thirty different kinds
of them exist in the Amazon valley, from the “coatas,”
and other howlers as large as baboons, to the tiny little
“ouistitis” and “säimiris,” not bigger than squirrels or
rats.</p>

<p class='c016'>While we must admit a paucity in the species of the
quadrupeds of the Amazon, the same remark does not
apply to the birds. In the ornithological department of
natural history, a fulness and richness here exist, perhaps
not equalled elsewhere. The most singular and
graceful forms, combined with the most brilliant plumage,
are everywhere presented to the eye, in the parrots and
great macaws, the toucans, trogons, and tanagers, the
shrikes, humming-birds, and orioles; and even in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>vultures and eagles: for here are found the most beautiful
of predatory birds,—the king vulture and the
harpy eagle. Of the feathered creatures existing in
the valley of the Amazon there are not less than one
thousand different species, of which only one half have
yet been caught or described.</p>

<p class='c016'>Reptiles are equally abundant—the serpent family
being represented by numerous species, from the great
water boa (<i>anaconda</i>), of ten yards in length, to the tiny
and beautiful but venomous <i>lachesis</i>, or coral snake, not
thicker than the shank of a tobacco-pipe. The lizards
range through a like gradation, beginning with the huge
“jacare,” or crocodile, of several species, and ending
with the turquoise-blue <i>anolius</i>, not bigger than a newt.</p>

<p class='c016'>The waters too are rich in species of their peculiar
inhabitants—of which the most remarkable and valuable
are the <i>manatees</i> (two or three species), the great
and smaller turtles, the porpoises of various kinds, and
an endless catalogue of the finny tribes that frequent the
rivers of the tropics. It is mainly from this source, and
not from four-footed creatures of the forest, that the
human denizen of the great Montaña draws his supply
of food,—at least that portion of it which may be
termed the “meaty.” Were it not for the <i>manatee</i>, the
great porpoise, and other large fish, he would often have
to “eat his bread dry.”</p>

<p class='c016'>And now it is <i>his</i> turn to be “talked about.” I need
not inform you that the aborigines, who inhabit the
valley of the Amazon, are all of the so-called <i>Indian</i>
race—though there are so many distinct tribes of them
that almost every river of any considerable magnitude
has a tribe of its own. In some cases a number of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>tribes belong to one <i>nationality</i>; that is, several of them
may be found speaking nearly the same language, though
living apart from each other; and of these larger divisions
or nationalities there are several occupying the
different districts of the Montaña. The tribes even of
the same nationality do not always present a uniform
appearance. There are darker and fairer tribes; some
in which the average standard of height is less than
among Europeans; and others where it equals or exceeds
this. There are tribes again where both men and
women are ill-shaped and ill-favored—though these are
few—and other tribes where both sexes exhibit a considerable
degree of personal beauty. Some tribes are
even distinguished for their good looks, the men presenting
models of manly form, while the women are
equally attractive by the regularity of their features,
and the graceful modesty of expression that adorns them.</p>

<p class='c016'>A minute detail of the many peculiarities in which
the numerous tribes of the Amazon differ from one
another would fill a large volume; and in a sketch like
the present, which is meant to include them all, it would
not be possible to give such a detail. Nor indeed would
it serve any good purpose; for although there are many
points of difference between the different tribes, yet these
are generally of slight importance, and are far more
than counterbalanced by the multitude of resemblances.
So numerous are these last, as to create a strong <i>idiosyncrasy</i>
in the tribes of the Amazon, which not only
entitles them to be classed together in an ethnological
point of view, but which separates them from all the
other Indians of America. Of course, the non-possession
of the horse—they do not even know the animal—at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>once broadly distinguishes them from the Horse
Indians, both of the Northern and Southern divisions of
the continent.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would be idle here to discuss the question as to
whether the Amazonian Indians have all a common
origin. It is evident they have not. We know that
many of them are from Peru and Bogota—runaways
from Spanish oppression. We know that others migrated
from the south—equally fugitives from the still
more brutal and barbarous domination of the Portuguese.
And still others were true aboriginals of the
soil, or if emigrants, when and whence came they?
An idle question, never to be satisfactorily answered.
There they now are, and <i>as they are</i> only shall we here
consider them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding the different sources whence they
sprang, we find them, as I have already said, stamped
with a certain idiosyncrasy, the result, no doubt, of the
like circumstances which surround them. One or two
tribes alone, whose habits are somewhat “odder” than
the rest, have been treated to a separate chapter; but
for the others, whatever is said of one, will, with very
slight alteration, stand good for the whole of the Amazonian
tribes. Let it be understood that we are discoursing
only of those known as the “Indios bravos,”
the fierce, brave, savage, or wild Indians—as you may
choose to translate the phrase,—a phrase used throughout
all Spanish America to distinguish those tribes, or
sections of tribes, who refused obedience to Spanish
tyranny, and who preserve to this hour their native independence
and freedom. In contradistinction to the
“Indios bravos” are the “Indios mansos,” or “tame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Indians,” who submitted tamely both to the cross and
sword, and now enjoy a rude demi-semi-civilization, under
the joint protectorate of priests and soldiers. Between
these two kinds of American aborigines, there
is as much difference as between a lord and his serf—the
true savage representing the former and the demi-semi-civilized
savage approximating more nearly to the
latter. The meddling monk has made a complete failure
of it. His ends were purely political, and the result
has proved ruinous to all concerned;—instead of civilizing
the savage, he has positively demoralized him.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not of his neophytes, the “Indios mansos,” we
are now writing, but of the “infidels,” who would not
hearken to his voice or listen to his teachings—those
who could never be brought within “sound of the bell.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Both “kinds” dwell within the valley of the Amazon,
but in different places. The “Indios mansos” may be
found along the banks of the main stream, from its
source to its mouth—but more especially on its upper
waters, where it runs through Spanish (Peruvian) territory.
There they dwell in little villages or collections
of huts, ruled by the missionary monk with iron rod,
and performing for him all the offices of the menial
slave. Their resources are few, not even equalling those
of their wild but independent brethren; and their customs
and religion exhibit a ludicrous <i>mélange</i> of savagery
and civilization. Farther down the river, the
“Indio manso” is a “tapuio,” a hireling of the Portuguese,
or to speak more correctly, a <i>slave</i>; for the latter
treats him as such, considers him as such, and though
there is a law against it, often drags him from his forest-home
and keeps him in life-long bondage. Any human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>law would be a dead letter among such white-skins as
are to be encountered upon the banks of the Amazon.
Fortunately they are but few; a town or two on the
lower Amazon and Rio Negro,—some wretched villages
between,—scattered <i>estancias</i> along the banks—with
here and there a paltry post of “militarios,” dignified
by the name of a “fort:” these alone speak the
progress of the Portuguese civilization throughout a period
of three centuries!</p>

<p class='c016'>From all these settlements the wild Indian keeps
away. He is never found near them—he is never
seen by travellers, not even by the settlers. You may
descend the mighty Amazon from its source to its mouth,
and not once set your eyes upon the true son of the
forest—the “Indio bravo.” Coming in contact only
with the neophyte of the Spanish missionary, and the
skulking <i>tapuio</i> of the Portuguese trader, you might
bring away a very erroneous impression of the character
of an Amazonian Indian.</p>

<p class='c016'>Where is he to be seen? where dwells he? what-like
is his home? what sort of a house does he build? His
costume? his arms? his occupation? his habits? These
are the questions you would put. They shall all be
answered, but briefly as possible—since our limited
space requires brevity.</p>

<p class='c016'>The wild Indian, then, is not to be found upon the
Amazon itself, though there are long reaches of the
river where he is free to roam—hundreds of miles
without either town or <i>estancia</i>. He hunts, and occasionally
fishes by the great water, but does not there
make his dwelling—though in days gone by, its shores
were his favorite place of residence. These happy days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>were before the time when Orellana floated down past
the door of his “malocca”—before that dark hour when
the Brazilian slave-hunter found his way into the waters
of the mighty <i>Solimoes</i>. This last event was the cause
of his disappearance. It drove him from the shores of
his beloved river-sea; forced him to withdraw his dwelling
from observation, and rebuild it far up, on those
tributaries where he might live a more peaceful life,
secure from the trafficker in human flesh. Hence it is
that the home of the Amazonian Indian is now to be
sought for—not on the Amazon itself, but on its tributary
streams—on the “caños” and “igaripes,” the canals
and lagoons that, with a labyrinthine ramification,
intersect the mighty forest of the Montaña. Here dwells
he, and here is he to be seen by any one bold enough to
visit him in his fastness home.</p>

<p class='c016'>How is he domiciled? Is there anything peculiar
about the style of his house or his village?</p>

<p class='c016'>Eminently peculiar; for in this respect he differs from
all the other savage people of whom we have yet written,
or of whom we may have occasion to write.</p>

<p class='c016'>Let us proceed at once to describe his dwelling. It is
not a tent, nor is it a hut, nor a cabin, nor a cottage, nor
yet a cave! His dwelling can hardly be termed a house,
nor his village a collection of houses—since both house
and village are one and the same, and both are so peculiar,
that we have no name for such a structure in
civilized lands, unless we should call it a “barrack.”
But even this appellation would give but an erroneous
idea of the Amazonian dwelling; and therefore we shall
use that by which it is known in the “Lingoa geral,”
and call it a <i>malocca</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>By such name is his house (or village rather) known
among the <i>tapuios</i> and traders of the Amazon. Since
it is both house and village at the same time, it must
needs be a large structure; and so is it, large enough to
contain the whole tribe—or at least the section of it
that has chosen one particular spot for their residence.
It is the property of the whole community, built by the
labor of all, and used as their common dwelling—though
each family has its own section specially set
apart for itself. It will thus be seen that the Amazonian
savage is, to some extent, a disciple of the Socialist
school.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have not space to enter into a minute account of the
architecture of the <i>malocca</i>. Suffice it to say, that it is
an immense temple-like building, raised upon timber
uprights, so smooth and straight as to resemble columns.
The beams and rafters are also straight and smooth, and
are held in their places by “sipos” (tough creeping
plants), which are whipped around the joints with a
neatness and compactness equal to that used in the rigging
of a ship. The roof is a thatch of palm-leaves,
laid on with great regularity, and brought very low down
at the eaves, so as to give to the whole structure the appearance
of a gigantic beehive. The walls are built of
split palms or bamboos, placed so closely together as to
be impervious to either bullet or arrows.</p>

<p class='c016'>The plan is a parallelogram, with a semicircle at one
end; and the building is large enough to accommodate
the whole community, often numbering more than a
hundred individuals. On grand festive occasions several
neighboring communities can find room enough in it—even
for dancing—and three or four hundred individuals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>not unfrequently assemble under the roof of a single
<i>malocca</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Inside the arrangements are curious. There is a wide
hall or avenue in the middle—that extends from end to
end throughout the whole length of the parallelogram—and
on both sides of the hall is a row of partitions,
separated from each other by split palms or canes, closely
placed. Each of these sections is the abode of a family,
and the place of deposit for the hammocks, clay pots,
calabash-cups, dishes, baskets, weapons, and ornaments,
which are the private property of each. The hall is
used for the larger cooking utensils—such as the great
clay ovens and pans for baking the cassava, and boiling
the <i>caxire</i> or <i>chicha</i>. This is also a neutral ground,
where the children play, and where the dancing is done
on the occasion of grand “balls” and other ceremonial
festivals.</p>

<p class='c016'>The common doorway is in the gable end, and is six
feet wide by ten in height. It remains open during the
day, but is closed at night by a mat of palm-fibre suspended
from the top. There is another and smaller
doorway at the semicircular end; but this is for the
private use of the chief, who appropriates the whole
section of the semicircle to himself and his family.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course the above is only the general outline of a
<i>malocca</i>. A more particular description would not answer
for that of all the tribes of the Amazon. Among
different communities, and in different parts of the Montaña,
the <i>malocco</i> varies in size, shape, and the materials
of which it is built; and there are some tribes who live
in separate huts. These exceptions, however, are few,
and as a general thing, that above described is the style
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>of habitation throughout the whole Montaña, from the
confines of Peru to the shores of the Atlantic. North
and south we encounter this singular house-village, from
the head-waters of the Rio Negro to the highlands of
Brazil.</p>

<p class='c016'>Most of the Amazonian tribes follow agriculture, and
understood the art of tillage before the coming of the
Spaniards. They practise it, however, to a very limited
extent. They cultivate a little manioc, and know
how to manufacture it into <i>farinha</i> or <i>cassava</i> bread.
They plant the <i>musaceæ</i> and yam, and understand the
distillation of various drinks, both from the plantain and
several kinds of palms. They can make pottery from
clay,—shaping it into various forms, neither rude nor
inelegant,—and from the trees and parasitical twiners
that surround their dwellings, they manufacture an endless
variety of neat implements and utensils.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their canoes are hollow trunks of trees sufficiently
well shaped, and admirably adapted to their mode of
travelling—which is almost exclusively by water, by
the numerous <i>caños</i> and <i>igaripes</i>, which are the roads
and paths of their country—often as narrow and intricate
as paths by land.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Indians of the tropic forest dress in the very lightest
costume. Of course each tribe has its own fashion;
but a mere belt of cotton cloth, or the inner bark of a
tree, passed round the waist and between the limbs, is
all the covering they care for. It is the <i>guayuco</i>. Some
wear a skirt of tree-bark, and, on grand occasions, feather
tunics are seen, and also plume head-dresses, made of the
brilliant wing and tail feathers of parrots and macaws.
Circlets of these also adorn the arms and limbs. All the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>tribes paint, using the <i>anotto</i>, <i>caruto</i>, and several other
dyes which they obtain from various kinds of trees, elsewhere
more particularly described.</p>

<p class='c016'>There are one or two tribes who <i>tattoo</i> their skins
but this strange practice is far less common among the
American Indians than with the natives of the Pacific
isles.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the manufacture of their various household utensils
and implements, as well as their weapons for war and the
chase, many tribes of Amazonian Indians display an ingenuity
that would do credit to the most accomplished
artisans. The hammocks made by them have been admired
everywhere; and it is from the valley of the Amazon
that most of these are obtained, so much prized
in the cities of Spanish and Portuguese America. They
are the special manufacture of the women, the men only
employing their mechanical skill on their weapons.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hammock, “rede,” or “maqueira,” is manufactured
out of strings obtained from the young leaves of
several species of palms. The <i>astrocaryum</i>, or “tucum”
palm furnishes this cordage, but a still better quality is
obtained from the “miriti” (<i>Mauritia flexuosa</i>). The
unopened leaf, which forms a thick-pointed column growing
up out of the crown of the tree, is cut off at the base,
and this being pulled apart, is shaken dexterously until
the tender leaflets fall out. These being stripped of
their outer covering, leave behind a thin tissue of a pale-yellowish
color, which is the fibre for making the cordage.
After being tied in bundles this fibre is left awhile to
dry, and is then twisted by being rolled between the hand
and the hip or thigh. The women perform this process
with great dexterity. Taking two strands of fibre between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the forefinger and thumb of the left hand, they lay them
separated a little along the thigh; a roll downward gives
them a twist, and then being adroitly brought together, a
roll upwards completes the making of the cord. Fifty
fathoms in a day is considered a good day’s spinning.
The cords are afterwards dyed of various colors, to render
them more ornamental when woven into the maqueira.</p>

<p class='c016'>The making of this is a simple process. Two horizontal
rods are placed at about seven feet apart, over which
the cord is passed some fifty or sixty times, thus forming
the “woof.” The warp is then worked in by knotting
the cross strings at equal distances apart, until there are
enough. Two strong cords are then inserted where the
rods pass through, and these being firmly looped, so as
to draw all the parallel strings together, the rod is pulled
out, and the hammock is ready to be used.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course, with very fine “redes,” and those intended
to be disposed of to the traders, much pains are taken in
the selection of the materials, the dyeing the cord, and
the weaving it into the hammock. Sometimes very expensive
articles are made ornamented with the brilliant
feathers of birds cunningly woven among the meshes and
along the borders.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides making the hammock, which is the universal
couch of the Amazonian Indian, the women also manufacture
a variety of beautiful baskets. Many species of
palms and <i>calamus</i> supply them with materials for this
purpose, one of the best being the “Iu” palm (<i>Astroca
ryum acaule</i>). They also make many implements and
utensils, some for cultivating the plantains, melons, and
<i>manioc</i> root, and others for manufacturing the last-named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>vegetable into their favorite “farinha” (<i>cassava</i>). The
Indians understood how to separate the poisonous juice
of this valuable root from its wholesome farina before
the arrival of white men among them; and the process
by which they accomplish this purpose has remained
without change up to the present hour, in fact, it is almost
the same as that practised by the Spaniards and Portuguese,
who simply adopted the Indian method. The
work is performed by the women, and thus: the roots
are brought home from the manioc “patch” in baskets,
and then washed and peeled. The peeling is usually
performed by the teeth; after that the roots are grated,
the grater being a large wooden slab about three feet
long, a foot wide, a little hollowed out, and the hollow
part covered all over with sharp pieces of quartz set in
regular diamond-shaped patterns. Sometime a cheaper
grater is obtained by using the aërial root of the pashiuba
palm (<i>Iriartea exhorhiza</i>), which, being thickly covered
over with hard spinous protuberances, serves admirably
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c016'>The grated pulp is next placed to dry upon a sieve,
made of the rind of a water-plant, and is afterwards put
into a long elastic cylinder-shaped basket or net, of the
bark of the “jacitara” palm (<i>Desmoncus macroacanthus</i>).
This is the <i>tipiti</i>; and at its lower end there is
a strong loop, through which a stout pole is passed;
while the <i>tipiti</i> itself, when filled with pulp, is hung up
to the branch of a tree, or to a firm peg in the wall.
One end of the pole is then rested against some projecting
point, that serves as a fulcrum, while the Indian
woman, having seated herself upon the other end, with
her infant in her arms, or perhaps some work in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>hands acts as the lever power. Her weight draws the
sides of the <i>tipiti</i> together, until it assumes the form
of an inverted cone; and thus the juice is gradually
pressed out of the pulp, and drops into a vessel placed
underneath to receive it. The mother must be careful
that the little imp does not escape from under her eye,
and perchance quench its thirst out of the vessel below.
If such an accident were to take place, in a very few
minutes she would have to grieve for a lost child; since
the sap of the manioc root, the variety most cultivated
by the Indians, is a deadly poison. This is the “yucca
amarga,” or bitter manioc; the “yucca dulce,” or
sweet kind, being quite innoxious, even if eaten in its
raw state.</p>

<p class='c016'>The remainder of the process consists in placing the
grated pulp—now sufficiently dry—on a large pan
or oven, and submitting it to the action of the fire. It
is then thought sufficiently good for Indian use; but
much of it is afterwards prepared for commerce, under
different names, and sold as <i>semonilla</i> (erroneously called
<i>semolina</i>), sago, and even as arrowroot.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the bottom of that poisonous tub, a sediment has
all the while been forming. That is the <i>starch</i> of the
manioc root—the <i>tapioca</i> of commerce: of course that
is not thrown away.</p>

<p class='c016'>The men of the tropic forest spend their lives in
doing very little. They are idle and not much disposed
to work—only when war or the chase calls them forth
do they throw aside for awhile their indolent habit, and
exhibit a little activity.</p>

<p class='c016'>They hunt with the bow and arrow, and fish with a
harpoon spear, nets, and sometimes by poisoning the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>water with the juice of a vine called barbasco. The
“peixe boy,” “vaca marina,” or “manatee,”—all three
names being synonymes—is one of the chief animals of
their pursuit. All the waters of the Amazon valley
abound with manatees, probably of several species, and
these large creatures are captured by the harpoon, just
as seals or walrus are taken. Porpoises also frequent
the South-American rivers and large fresh-water fish
of numerous species. The game hunted by the Amazonian
Indians can scarcely be termed noble. We have
seen that the large <i>mammalia</i> are few, and thinly distributed
in the tropical forest. With the exception of
the jaguar and peccary, the chase is limited to small
quadrupeds—as the capibara, the paca, agouti—to
many kinds of monkeys, and an immense variety of
birds. The monkey is the most common game, and is
not only eaten by all the Amazonian Indians, but by
most of them considered as the choicest of food.</p>

<p class='c016'>In procuring their game the hunters sometimes use
the common bow and arrow, but most of the tribes are
in possession of a weapon which they prefer to all others
for this particular purpose. It is an implement of death
so original in its character and so singular in its construction
as to deserve a special and minute description.</p>

<p class='c016'>The weapon I allude to is the “blow-gun,” called
“pucuna” by the Indians themselves, “gravitana” by
the Spaniards, and “cerbatana” by the Portuguese of
Brazil.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the Amazonian Indian wishes to manufacture
for himself a <i>pucuna</i> he goes out into the forest and
searches for two tall, straight stems of the “pashiuba
miri” palm (<i>Iriartea setigera</i>). These he requires of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>such thickness that one can be contained within the other.
Having found what he wants, he cuts both down and
carries them home to his molocca. Neither of them is
of such dimensions as to render this either impossible or
difficult.</p>

<p class='c016'>He now takes a long slender rod—already prepared
for the purpose—and with this pushes out the pith
from both stems, just as boys do when preparing their
pop-guns from the stems of the elder-tree. The rod
thus used is obtained from another species of <i>Iriartea</i>
palm, of which the wood is very hard and tough. A
little tuft of fern-root, fixed upon the end of the rod, is
then drawn backward and forward through the tubes,
until both are cleared of any pith which may have adhered
to the interior; and both are polished by this
process to the smoothness of ivory. The palm of
smaller diameter, being scraped to a proper size, is now
inserted into the tube of the larger, the object being to
correct any crookedness in either, should there be such;
and if this does not succeed, both are whipped to some
straight beam or post, and thus left till they become
straight. One end of the bore, from the nature of the
tree, is always smaller than the other; and to this end
is fitted a mouth-piece of two peccary tusks to concentrate
the breath of the hunter when blowing into the
tube. The other end is the muzzle; and near this, on
the top, a sight is placed, usually a tooth of the “paca”
or some other rodent animal. This sight is glued on
with a gum which another tropic tree furnishes. Over
the outside, when desirous of giving the weapon an
ornamental finish, the maker winds spirally a shining
creeper, and then the <i>pucuna</i> is ready for action.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Sometimes only a single shank of palm is used, and
instead of the pith being pushed out, the stem is split
into two equal parts throughout its whole extent. The
heart substance being then removed, the two pieces are
brought together, like the two divisions of a cedarwood
pencil, and tightly bound with a sipo.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>pucuna</i> is usually about an inch and a half in
diameter at the thickest end, and the bore about equal
to that of a pistol of ordinary calibre. In length, however,
the weapon varies from eight to twelve feet.</p>

<p class='c016'>This singular instrument is designed, not for propelling
a bullet, but an arrow; but as this arrow differs
altogether from the common kind it also needs to be
described.</p>

<p class='c016'>The blow-gun arrow is about fifteen or eighteen
inches long, and is made of a piece of split bamboo;
but when the “patawa” palm can be found, this tree
furnishes a still better material, in the long spines that
grow out from the sheathing bases of its leaves. These
are 18 inches in length, of a black color, flattish though
perfectly straight. Being cut to the proper length—which
most of them are without cutting—they are
whittled at one end to a sharp point. This point is
dipped about three inches deep in the celebrated
“curare” poison; and just where the poison mark terminates,
a notch is made, so that the head will be easily
broken off when the arrow is in the wound. Near the
other end a little soft down of silky cotton (the floss of
the <i>bombax ceiba</i>) is twisted around into a smooth mass
of the shape of a spinning-top, with its larger end
towards the nearer extremity of the arrow. The cotton
is held in its place by being lightly whipped on by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>delicate thread or fibre of a <i>bromelia</i>, and the mass is
just big enough to fill the tube by gently pressing it
inward.</p>

<p class='c016'>The arrow thus made is inserted, and whenever the
game is within reach the Indian places his mouth to the
lower end or mouth-piece, and with a strong “puff,”
which practice enables him to give, he sends the little
messenger upon its deadly errand. He can hit with unerring
aim at the distance of forty or fifty paces; but he
prefers to shoot in a direction nearly vertical, as in that
way he can take the surest aim. As his common game—birds
and monkeys—are usually perched upon the
higher branches of tall trees, their situation just suits
him. Of course it is not the mere wound of the arrow
that kills these creatures, but the poison, which in two
or three minutes after they have been hit, will bring
either bird or monkey to the ground. When the latter
is struck he would be certain to draw out the arrow; but
the notch, already mentioned, provides against this, as
the slightest wrench serves to break off the envenomed
head.</p>

<p class='c016'>These arrows are dangerous things,—even for the
manufacturer of them to play with: they are therefore
carried in a quiver, and with great care,—the quiver
consisting either of a bamboo joint or a neat wicker
case.</p>

<p class='c016'>The weapons of war used by the forest tribes are the
common bow and arrows, also tipped with <i>curare</i>, and
the “macana,” or war-club, a species peculiar to South
America, made out of the hard heavy wood of the <i>pissaba</i>
palm. Only one or two tribes use the spear; and both
the “bolas” and lazo are quite unknown, as such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>weapons would not be available among the trees of the
forest. These are the proper arms of the Horse-Indian,
the dweller on the open plains; but without them,
for all war purposes, the forest tribes have weapons
enough, and, unfortunately, make a too frequent use of
them.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE WATER-DWELLERS OF MARACAIBO.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>The Andes mountains, rising in the extreme southern
point of South America, not only extend throughout the
whole length of that continent, but continue on through
Central America and Mexico, under the name of “Cordilleras
de Sierra Madre;” and still farther north to the
shores of the Arctic Sea, under the very inappropriate
appellation of the “Rocky Mountains.” You must not
suppose that these stupendous mountains form one continuous
elevation. At many places they furcate into
various branches, throwing off spurs, and sometime parallel
“sierras,” between which lie wide “valles,” or level
plains of great extent. It is upon these high plateaux—many
of them elevated 7,000 feet above the sea—that
the greater part of the Spanish-American population
dwells; and on them too are found most of the large
cities of Spanish South America and Mexico.</p>

<p class='c016'>These parallel chains meet at different points, forming
what the Peruvians term “nodas” (knots); and, after
continuing for a distance in one great cordillera, again
bifurcate. One of the most remarkable of these bifurcations
of the Andes occurs about latitude 2° N. There the
gigantic sierra separates into two great branches, forming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a shape like the letter Y, the left limb being that which
is usually regarded as the main continuation of these
mountains through the Isthmus of Panama, while the
right forms the eastern boundary of the great valley of
the Magdalena river; and then, trending in an eastwardly
direction along the whole northern coast of South America
to the extreme point of the promontory of Paria.</p>

<p class='c016'>Each of these limbs again forks into several branches
or spurs,—the whole system forming a figure that may
be said to bear some resemblance to a genealogical tree
containing the pedigree of four or five generations.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is only with one of the bifurcations of the right or
eastern sierra that this sketch has to do. On reaching
the latitude of 7° north, this chain separates itself into
two wings, which, after diverging widely to the east and
west, sweep round again towards each other, as if desirous
to be once more united. The western wing advances
boldly to this reunion; but the eastern, after vacillating
for a time, as if uncertain what course to take, turns its
back abruptly on its old comrade, and trends off in a due
east direction, till it sinks into insignificance upon the
promontory of Paria.</p>

<p class='c016'>The whole mass of the sierra, however, has not been
of one mind; for, at the time of its indecision, a large
spur detaches itself from the main body, and sweeps
round, as if to carry out the union with the left wing
advancing from the west. Although they get within
sight of each other, they are not permitted to meet,—both
ending abruptly before the circle is completed, and
forming a figure bearing a very exact resemblance to
the shoe of a racehorse. Within this curving boundary
is enclosed a vast valley,—as large as the whole of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Ireland,—the central portion of which, and occupying
about one third of its whole extent, is a sheet of water,
known from the days of the discovery of America, as
the <i>Lake of Maracaibo</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It obtained this appellation from the name of an Indian
cazique, who was met upon its shores by the first discoverers;
but although this lake was known to the earliest
explorers of the New World,—although it lies contiguous
to many colonial settlements both on the mainland
and the islands of the Caribbean Sea,—the lake itself,
and the vast territory that surrounds it, remain almost as
unknown and obscure as if they were situated among the
central deserts of Africa.</p>

<p class='c016'>And yet the valley of Maracaibo is one of the most
interesting portions of the globe,—interesting not only
as a <i>terra incognita</i>, but on account of the diversified
nature of its scenery and productions. It possesses a
<i>fauna</i> of a peculiar kind, and its <i>flora</i> is one of the richest
in the world, not surpassed,—perhaps not equalled,—by
that of any other portion of the torrid zone. To
give a list of its vegetable productions would be to
enumerate almost every species belonging to tropical
America. Here are found the well-known medicinal
plants,—the sassafras and sarsaparilla, guaiacum, copaiva,
cinchona, and cuspa, or <i>Cortex Angosturæ</i>; here
are the deadly poisons of <i>barbasco</i> and <i>mavacure</i>, and
alongside them the remedies of the “palo sano,” and
<i>mikania guaco</i>. Here likewise grow plants and trees
producing those well-known dyes of commerce, the blue
indigo, the red arnotto, the lake-colored chica, the brazilletto,
and dragon’s blood; and above all, those woods of
red, gold, and ebon tints, so precious in the eyes of the
cabinet and musical-instrument makers of Europe.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Yet, strange to say, these rich resources lie, like treasures
buried in the bowels of the earth, or gems at the
bottom of the sea, still undeveloped. A few small lumbering
establishments near the entrance of the lake,—here
and there a miserable village, supported by a little
coast commerce in dye-woods, or cuttings of ebony,—now
and then a hamlet of fishermen,—a “hato” of
goats and sheep; and at wider intervals, a “ganaderia”
of cattle, or a plantation of cocoa-trees (<i>cocale</i>), furnish
the only evidence that man has asserted his dominion
over this interesting region. These settlements, however,
are sparsely distributed, and widely distant from one
another. Between them stretch broad savannas and
forests,—vast tracts, untilled and even unexplored,—a
very wilderness, but a wilderness rich in natural resources.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Lake of Maracaibo is often, though erroneously,
described as an arm of the sea. This description only
applies to the <i>Gulf of Maracaibo</i>, which is in reality a
portion of the Caribbean Sea. The lake itself is altogether
different, and is a true fresh-water lake, separated
from the gulf by a narrow neck or strait. Within this
strait—called “boca,” or mouth—the salt water does
not extend, except during very high tides or after long-continued
<i>nortes</i> (north winds), which have the effect of
driving the sea-water up into the lake, and imparting to
some portions of it a saline or brackish taste. This,
however, is only occasional and of temporary continuance;
and the waters of the lake, supplied by a hundred
streams from the horseshoe sierra that surrounds it, soon
return to their normal character of freshness.</p>

<p class='c016'>The shape of Lake Maracaibo is worthy of remark.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The main body of its surface is of oval outline,—the
longer diameter running north and south,—but taken in
connection with the straits which communicate with the
outer gulf, it assumes a shape somewhat like that of a
Jew’s-harp, or rather of a kind of guitar, most in use
among Spanish Americans, and known under the name
of “mandolin” (or “bandolon”). To this instrument do
the natives sometimes compare it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another peculiarity of Lake Maracaibo, is the extreme
shallowness of the water along its shores. It is deep
enough towards the middle part; but at many points
around the shore, a man may wade for miles into the
water, without getting beyond his depth. This peculiarity
arises from the formation of the valley in which
it is situated. Only a few spurs of the sierras that
surround it approach near the edge of the lake. Generally
from the bases of the mountains, the land slopes
with a very gentle declination,—so slight as to have the
appearance of a perfectly horizontal plain,—and this is
continued for a great way under the surface of the water.
Strange enough, however, after getting to a certain distance
from the shore, the shoal water ends as abruptly as
the escarpment of a cliff, and a depth almost unfathomable
succeeds,—as if the central part of the lake was a vast
subaqueous ravine, bounded on both sides by precipitous
cliffs. Such, in reality, is it believed to be.</p>

<p class='c016'>A singular phenomenon is observed in the Lake Maracaibo,
which, since the days of Columbus, has not only
puzzled the curious, but also the learned and scientific,
who have unsuccessfully attempted to explain it. This
phenomenon consists in the appearance of a remarkable
light, which shows itself in the middle of the night, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>at a particular part of the lake, near its southern extremity.
This light bears some resemblance to the <i>ignis
fatuus</i> of our own marshes; and most probably is a
phosphorescence of a similar nature, though on a much
grander scale,—since it is visible at a vast distance
across the open water. As it is seen universally in the
same direction, and appears fixed in one place, it serves
as a beacon for the fishermen and dye-wood traders who
navigate the waters of the lake,—its longitude being
precisely that of the straits leading outward to the gulf.
Vessels that have strayed from their course, often regulate
their reckoning by the mysterious “Farol de Maracaibo”
(Lantern of Maracaibo),—for by this name is
the natural beacon known the mariners of the lake.</p>

<p class='c016'>Various explanations have been offered to account for
this singular phenomenon, but none seem to explain it in
a satisfactory manner. It appears to be produced by the
exhalations that arise from an extensive marshy tract
lying around the mouth of the river Zulia, and above
which it universally shows itself. The atmosphere in
this quarter is usually hotter than elsewhere, and supposed
to be highly charged with electricity; but whatever
may be the chemical process which produces the
illumination, it acts in a perfectly silent manner. No
one has ever observed any explosion to proceed from it,
or the slightest sound connected with its occurrence.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of all the ideas suggested by the mention of Lake
Maracaibo, perhaps none are so interesting as those that
relate to its native inhabitants, whose peculiar habits and
modes of life not only astonished the early navigators,
but eventually gave its name to the lake itself, and to
the extensive province in which it is situated. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the Spanish discoverers, sailing around the shores of the
gulf, arrived near the entrance of Lake Maracaibo, they
saw, to their amazement, not only single houses, but
whole villages, apparently floating upon the water! On
approaching nearer, they perceived that these houses
were raised some feet above the surface, and supported
by posts or piles driven into the mud at the bottom.
The idea of Venice—that city built upon the sea, to
which they had been long accustomed—was suggested
by these <i>superaqueous</i> habitations; and the name of
<i>Venezuela</i> (Little Venice) was at once bestowed upon
the coast, and afterwards applied to the whole province
now known as the Republic of Venezuela.</p>

<p class='c016'>Though the “water villages” then observed have
long since disappeared, many others of a similar kind
were afterwards discovered in Lake Maracaibo itself,
some of which are in existence to the present day.
Besides here and there an isolated habitation, situated
in some bay or “laguna,” there are four principal villages
upon this plan still in existence, each containing
from fifty to a hundred habitations. The inhabitants of
some of these villages have been “Christianized,” that
is, have submitted to the teaching of the Spanish missionaries;
and one in particular is distinguished by
having its little church—a regular <i>water</i> church—in
the centre, built upon piles, just as the rest of the
houses are, and only differing from the common dwellings
in being larger and of a somewhat more pretentious
style. From the belfry of this curious ecclesiastical
edifice a brazen bell may be heard at morn and
eve tolling the “oracion” and “vespers,” and declaring
over the wide waters of the lake that the authority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the Spanish monk has replaced the power of the cazique
among the Indians of the Lake Maracaibo. Not to
all sides of the lake, however, has the cross extended
its conquest. Along its western shore roams the fierce
unconquered Goajiro, who, a true warrior, still maintains
his independence; and even encroaches upon the
usurped possessions both of monk and “militario.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>water-dweller</i>, however, although of kindred race
with the Goajiro, is very different, both in his disposition
and habits of life. He is altogether a man of
peace, and might almost be termed a civilized being,—that
is, he follows a regular industrial calling, by which
he subsists. This is the calling of a fisherman, and in
no part of the world could he follow it with more certainty
of success, since the waters which surround his
dwelling literally swarm with fish.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lake Maracaibo has been long noted as the resort of
numerous and valuable species of the finny tribe, in the
capture of which the Indian fisherman finds ample occupation.
He is betimes a fowler,—as we shall presently
see,—and he also sometimes indulges, though more
rarely, in the chase, finding game in the thick forests
or on the green savannas that surround the lake, or
border the banks of the numerous “riachos” (streams)
running into it. On the savanna roams the graceful
roebuck and the “venado,” or South-American deer,
while along the river banks stray the capibara and the
stout tapir, undisturbed save by their fierce feline enemies,
the puma and spotted jaguar.</p>

<p class='c016'>But hunting excursions are not a habit of the water
Indian, whose calling, as already observed, is essentially
that of a fisherman and “fowler,” and whose subsistence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>is mainly derived from two kinds of <i>water-dwellers</i>, like
himself—one with fins, living below the surface, and
denominated <i>fish</i>; another with wings, usually resting
<i>on</i> the surface, and known as <i>fowl</i>. These two creatures,
of very different kinds and of many different
species, form the staple and daily food of the Indian
of Maracaibo.</p>

<p class='c016'>In an account of his habits we shall begin by giving
a description of the mode in which he constructs his
singular dwelling.</p>

<p class='c016'>Like other builders he begins by selecting the site.
This must be a place where the water is of no great
depth; and the farther from the shore he can find a
shallow spot the better for his purpose, for he has a
good reason for desiring to get to a distance from the
shore, as we shall presently see. Sometimes a sort of
subaqueous island, or elevated sandbank, is found, which
gives him the very site he is in search of. Having
pitched upon the spot, his next care is to procure a
certain number of tree-trunks of the proper length and
thickness to make “piles.” Not every kind of timber
will serve for this purpose, for there are not many
sorts that would long resist decay and the wear and
tear of the water insects, with which the lake abounds.
Moreover, the building of one of these aquatic houses,
although it be only a rude hut, is a work of time and
labor, and it is desirable therefore to make it as permanent
as possible. For this reason great care is taken
in the selection of the timber for the “piles.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But it so chances that the forests around the lake
furnish the very thing itself, in the wood of a tree
known to the Spanish inhabitants as the “vera,” or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“palo sano,” and to the natives as “guaiac.” It is
one of the zygophyls of the genus <i>Guaiacum</i>, of which
there are many species, called by the names of “iron-wood”
or “lignum-vitæ;” but the species in question
is the <i>tree</i> lignum-vitæ (<i>Guaiacum arboreum</i>), which attains
to a height of 100 feet, with a fine umbrella-shaped
head, and bright orange flowers. Its wood is
so hard, that it will turn the edge of an axe, and the
natives believe that if it be buried for a sufficient length
of time under the earth it will turn to iron! Though
this belief is not literally true, as regards the <i>iron</i>, it
is not so much of an exaggeration as might be supposed.
The “palo de fierro,” when buried in the soil
of Maracaibo or immersed in the waters of the lake,
in reality does undergo a somewhat similar metamorphose;
in other words, it turns into stone; and the
petrified trunks of this wood are frequently met with
along the shores of the lake. What is still more singular—the
piles of the water-houses often become petrified,
so that the dwelling no longer rests upon wooden
posts, but upon real columns of stone!</p>

<p class='c016'>Knowing all this by experience, the Indian selects the
guaiac for his uprights, cuts them of the proper length;
and then, launching them in the water, transports them
to the site of his dwelling, and fixes them in their places.</p>

<p class='c016'>Upon this a platform is erected, out of split boards of
some less ponderous timber, usually the “ceiba,” or
“silk-cotton tree” (<i>Bombax ceiba</i>), or the “cedro negro”
(<i>Cedrela odorata</i>) of the order <i>Meliaceæ</i>. Both kinds
grow in abundance upon the shores of the lake,—and
the huge trunks of the former are also used by the water
Indian for the constructing of his canoe.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>The platform, or floor, being thus established, about
two or three feet above the surface of the water, it then
only remains to erect the walls and cover them over with
a roof. The former are made of the slightest materials,—light
saplings or bamboo poles,—usually left open at
the interstices. There is no winter or cold weather here,—why
should the walls be thick? There are heavy rains,
however, at certain seasons of the year, and these
require to be guarded against; but this is not a difficult
matter, since the broad leaves of the “enea” and “vihai”
(a species of <i>Heliconia</i>) serve the purpose of a roof just
as well as tiles, slates, or shingles. Nature in these parts
is bountiful, and provides her human creatures with a
spontaneous supply of every want. Even ropes and
cords she furnishes, for binding the beams, joists, and
rafters together, and holding on the thatch against the
most furious assaults of the wind. The numerous species
of creeping and twining plants (“llianas” or “sipos”)
serve admirably for this purpose. They are applied in
their green state, and when contracted by exsiccation
draw the timbers as closely together as if held by spikes
of iron. In this manner and of such materials does the
water Indian build his house.</p>

<p class='c016'>Why he inhabits such a singular dwelling is a question
that requires to be answered. With the <i>terra firma</i>
close at hand, and equally convenient for all purposes of
his calling, why does he not build his hut there? So
much easier too of access would it be, for he could then
approach it either by land or by water; whereas, in its
present situation, he can neither go away from his house
or get back to it without the aid of his “periagua” (canoe).
Moreover, by building on the beach, or by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>edge of the woods, he would spare himself the labor of
transporting those heavy piles and setting them in their
places,—a work, as already stated, of no ordinary
magnitude. Is it for personal security against human
enemies,—for this sometimes drives a people to seek
singular situations for their homes? No; the Indian
of Maracaibo has his human foes, like all other people;
but it is none of these that have forced him to adopt
this strange custom. Other enemies? wild beasts? the
dreaded jaguar, perhaps? No, nothing of this kind.
And yet it is in reality a living creature that drives him
to this resource,—that has forced him to flee from the
mainland and take to the water for security against its
attack,—a creature of such small dimensions, and apparently
so contemptible in its strength, that you will
no doubt smile at the idea of its putting a strong man
to flight,—a little insect exactly the size of an English
gnat, and no bigger, but so formidable by means of its
poisonous bite, and its myriads of numbers, as to render
many parts of the shores of Lake Maracaibo quite uninhabitable.
You guess, no doubt, the insect to which
I allude? You cannot fail to recognize it as the <i>mosquito</i>?
Just so; it is the mosquito I mean, and in no
part of South America do these insects abound in greater
numbers, and nowhere are they more bloodthirsty than
upon the borders of this great fresh-water sea. Not only
one species of mosquito, but all the varieties known as
“jejens,” “zancudos,” and “tempraneros,” here abound
in countless multitudes,—each kind making its appearance
at a particular hour of the day or night,—“mounting
guard” (as the persecuted natives say of them) in
turn, and allowing only short intervals of respite from
their bitter attacks.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Now, it so happens, that although the various kinds
of mosquitoes are peculiarly the productions of a marshy
or watery region,—and rarely found where the soil is
high and dry,—yet as rarely do they extend their excursions
to a distance from the land. They delight to
dwell under the shadow of leaves, or near the herbage
of grass, plants, or trees, among which they were hatched.
They do not stray far from the shore, and only when the
breeze carries them do they fly out over the open water.
Need I say more? You have now the explanation why
the Indians of Maracaibo build their dwellings upon the
water. It is simply to escape from the “plaga de moscas”
(the pest of the flies).</p>

<p class='c016'>Like most other Indians of tropical America, and some
even of colder latitudes, those of Maracaibo go naked,
wearing only the <i>guayuco</i>, or “waist-belt.” Those of
them, however, who have submitted to the authority of
the monks, have adopted a somewhat more modest garb,—consisting
of a small apron of cotton or palm-fibre,
suspended from the waist, and reaching down to their
knees.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have already stated, that the water-dwelling Indian
is a fisherman, and that the waters of the lake
supply him with numerous kinds of fish of excellent
quality. An account of these, with the method employed
in capturing them, may not prove uninteresting.</p>

<p class='c016'>First, there is the fish known as “liza,” a species of
skate. It is of a brilliant silvery hue, with bluish corruscations.
It is a small fish, being only about a foot
in length, but is excellent to eat, and when preserved
by drying, forms an article of commerce with the West-Indian
islands. Along the coasts of Cumana and Magarita,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>there are many people employed in the <i>pesca de
liza</i> (skate-fishery); but although the liza is in reality
a sea fish, it abounds in the fresh waters of Maracaibo,
and is there also an object of industrial pursuit. It is
usually captured by seines, made out of the fibres of
the <i>cocui aloe</i> (<i>agave cocuiza</i>), or of cords obtained from
the unexpanded leaflets of the moriche palm (<i>Mauritia
flexuosa</i>), both of which useful vegetable products are
indigenous to this region. The roe of the liza, when
dried in the sun, is an article in high estimation, and
finds its way into the channels of commerce.</p>

<p class='c016'>A still more delicate fish is the “pargo.” It is of a
white color tinged with rose; and of these great numbers
are also captured. So, too, with the “doncella,”
one of the most beautiful species, as its pretty name of
“doncella” (young maiden) would indicate. These last
are so abundant in some parts of the lake, that one of its
bays is distinguished by the name of <i>Laguna de Doncella</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>A large, ugly fish, called the “vagre,” with an enormous
head and wide mouth, from each side of which
stretches a beard-like appendage, is also an object of
the Indian’s pursuit. It is usually struck with a spear,
or killed by arrows, when it shows itself near the surface
of the water. Another monstrous creature, of nearly
circular shape, and full three feet in diameter, is the “carite,”
which is harpooned in a similar fashion.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides these there is the “viegita,” or “old-woman
fish,” which itself feeds upon lesser creatures of the finny
tribe, and especially upon the smaller species of shell-fish.
It has obtained its odd appellation from a singular
noise which it gives forth, and which resembles the voice
of an old woman debilitated with extreme age.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The “dorado,” or gilded fish—so called on account
of its beautiful color—is taken by a hook, with no other
bait attached than a piece of white rag. This, however,
must be kept constantly in motion, and the bait is played
by simply paddling the canoe over the surface of the
lake, until the dorado, attracted by the white meteor, follows
in its track, and eventually hooks itself.</p>

<p class='c016'>Many other species of fish are taken by the water-Indians,
as the “lebranche” which goes in large “schools,”
and makes its breeding-place in the lagunas and up the
rivers, and the “guabina,” with several kinds of sardines
that find their way into the tin boxes of Europe; for the
Maracaibo fisherman is not contented with an exclusive
fish diet. He likes a little “casava,” or maize-bread,
along with it; besides, he has a few other wants to satisfy,
and the means he readly obtains in exchange for the
surplus produce of his nets, harpoons, and arrows.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have already stated that he is a fowler. At certain
seasons of the year this is essentially his occupation.
The fowling season with him is the period of northern
winter, when the migratory aquatic birds come down
from the boreal regions of Prince Rupert’s Land to disport
their bodies in the more agreeable waters of Lake
Maracaibo. There they assemble in large flocks, darkening
the air with their myriads of numbers, now fluttering
over the lake, or, at other times, seated on its surface
silent and motionless. Notwithstanding their great numbers,
however, they are too shy to be approached near
enough for the “carry” of an Indian arrow, or a gun
either; and were it not for a very cunning stratagem
which the Indian has adopted for their capture, they
might return again to their northern haunts without being
<i>minus</i> an individual of their “count.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>But they are not permitted to depart thus unscathed.
During their sojourn within the limits of Lake Maracaibo
their legions get considerably thinned, and thousands
of them that settle down upon its inviting waters
are destined never more to take wing.</p>

<p class='c016'>To effect their capture, the Indian fowler, as already
stated, makes use of a very ingenious stratagem. Something
similar is described as being practised in other
parts of the world; but in no place is it carried to such
perfection as upon the Lake Maracaibo.</p>

<p class='c016'>The fowler first provides himself with a number of
large gourd-shells of roundish form, and each of them at
least as big as his own skull. These he can easily obtain,
either from the herbaceous squash (<i>Cucurbita lagenaris</i>)
or from the calabash tree (<i>Crescentia cujete</i>), both
of which grow luxuriantly on the shores of the lake.
Filling his periagua with these, he proceeds out into the
open water to a certain distance from the land, or from
his own dwelling. The distance is regulated by several
considerations. He must reach a place which, at all
hours of the day, the ducks and other waterfowl are not
afraid to frequent; and, on the other hand, he must not
go beyond such a depth as will bring the water higher
than his own chin when wading through it. This last
consideration is not of so much importance, for the water
Indian can swim almost as well as a duck, and dive like
one, if need be; but it is connected with another matter
of greater importance—the convenience of having the
birds as near as possible, to save him a too long and
wearisome “wade.” It is necessary to have them so
near, that at all hours they may be under his eye.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having found the proper situation, which the last extent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>of shoal water (already mentioned) enables him to
do, he proceeds to carry out his design by dropping a
gourd here and another there, until a large space of surface
is covered by these floating shells. Each gourd has
a stone attached to it by means of a string, which, resting
upon the bottom, brings the buoy to an anchor, and
prevents it from being drifted into the deeper water
or carried entirely away.</p>

<p class='c016'>When his decoys are all placed, the Indian paddles
back to his platform dwelling, and there, with watchful
eye, awaits the issue. The birds are at first shy of these
round yellow objects intruded upon their domain; but, as
the hours pass, and they perceive no harm in them, they
at length take courage and venture to approach. Urged
by that curiosity which is instinctive in every creature,
they gradually draw nigher and nigher, until at length
they boldly venture into the midst of the odd objects and
examine them minutely. Though puzzled to make out
what it is all meant for, they can perceive no harm
in the yellow globe-shaped things that only bob about,
but make no attempt to do them any injury. Thus satisfied,
their curiosity soon wears off, and the birds no
longer regarding the floating shells as objects of suspicion,
swim freely about through their midst, or sit quietly
on the water side by side with them.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the crisis has now arrived when it is necessary
the Indian should act, and for this he speedily equips
himself. He first ties a stout rope around his waist, to
which are attached many short strings or cords. He then
draws over his head a large gourd-shell, which, fitting
pretty tightly, covers his whole skull, reaching down to
his neck. This shell is exactly similar to the others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>already floating on the water, with the exception of having
three holes on one side of it, two on the same level
with the Indian’s eyes, and the third opposite his mouth,
intended to serve him for a breathing-hole.</p>

<p class='c016'>He is now ready for work; and, thus oddly accoutred,
he slips quietly down from his platform, and laying himself
along the water, swims gently in the direction of
the ducks.</p>

<p class='c016'>He swims only where the water is too shallow to
prevent him from crouching below the surface; for were
he to stand upright, and wade,—even though he were
still distant from them,—the shy birds might have suspicions
about his after-approaches.</p>

<p class='c016'>When he reaches a point where the lake is sufficiently
deep, he gets upon his feet and wades, still keeping his
shoulders below the surface. He makes his advance
very slowly and warily, scarce raising a ripple on the
surface of the placid lake, and the nearer he gets to
his intended victims he proceeds with the greater caution.</p>

<p class='c016'>The unsuspecting birds see the destroyer approach
without having the slightest misgiving of danger. They
fancy that the new comer is only another of those inanimate
objects by their side—another gourd-shell drifting
out upon the water to join its companions. They have
no suspicion that this wooden counterfeit—like the horse
of Troy—is inhabited by a terrible enemy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor things! how could they? A stratagem so well
contrived would deceive more rational intellects than
theirs; and, in fact, having no idea of danger, they
perhaps do not trouble themselves even to notice the
new arrival.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Meanwhile the gourd has drifted silently into their
midst, and is seen approaching the odd individuals, first
one and afterwards another, as if it had some special
business with each. This business appears to be of a
very mysterious character; and in each case is abruptly
brought to a conclusion, by the duck making a sudden
dive under the water,—not head foremost, according to
its usual practice, but in the reverse way, as if jerked
down by the feet, and so rapidly that the creature has
not time to utter a single “quak.”</p>

<p class='c016'>After quite a number of individuals have disappeared
in this mysterious manner, the others sometimes grow
suspicious of the moving calabash, and either take to
wing, or swim off to a less dangerous neighborhood; but
if the gourd performs its office in a skilful manner, it
will be seen passing several times to and fro between
the birds and the water-village before this event takes
place. On each return trip, when far from the flock,
and near the habitations, it will be seen to rise high
above the surface of the water. It will then be perceived
that it covers the skull of a copper-colored savage,
around whose hips may be observed a double tier
of dead ducks dangling by their necks from the rope
upon his waist, and forming a sort of plumed skirt, the
weight of which almost drags its wearer back into the
water.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course a capture is followed by a feast; and during
the fowling season of the year the Maracaibo Indian
enjoys roast-duck at discretion. He does not trouble
his head much about the green peas, nor is he particular
to have his ducks stuffed with sage and onions; but a
hot seasoning of red pepper is one of the indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>ingredients of the South-American <i>cuisine</i>: and he
usually obtains from a small patch of capsicum which he
cultivates upon the adjacent shore; or, if he be not possessed
of land, he procures it by barter, exchanging his
fowls or fish for that and a little maize or manioc flour,
furnished by the coast-traders.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Maracaibo Indian is not a stranger to commerce.
He has been “Christianized,”—to use the phraseology
of his priestly proselytizer,—and this has introduced
him to new wants and necessities. Expenses that in his
former pagan state were entirely unknown to him, have
now become necessary, and a commercial effort is required
to meet them. The Church must have its dues.
Such luxuries as being baptized, married, and buried, are
not to be had without expense, and the padre takes good
care that none of these shall be had for nothing. He
has taught his proselyte to believe that unless all these
rites have been officially performed there is not the
slightest chance for him in the next world; and under
the influence of this delusion, the simple savage willingly
yields up his tenth, his fifth, or, perhaps it would be
more correct to say, his all. Between fees of baptism
and burial, mulcts for performance of the marriage rite,
contributions towards the shows and ceremonies of <i>dias
de fiesta</i>, extravagant prices for blessed beads, leaden
crucifixes, and images of patron saints, the poor Christianized
Indian is compelled to part with nearly the
whole of his humble gains; and the fear of not being
able to pay for Christian burial after death, is often one
of the torments of his life.</p>

<p class='c016'>To satisfy the numerous demands of the Church, therefore,
he is forced into a little action in the commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>line. With the water-dweller of Maracaibo, fish forms
one of the staples of export trade,—of course in the
preserved state, as he is too distant from any great town
or metropolis to be able to make market of them while
fresh. He understands, however, the mode of curing
them,—which he accomplishes by sun-drying and smoking,—and,
thus prepared, they are taken off his hands
by the trader, who carries them all over the West Indies,
where, with boiled rice, they form the staple food of
thousands of the dark-skinned children of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Maracaibo Indian, however, has still another resource,
which occasionally supplies him with an article
of commercial export. His country—that is, the adjacent
shores of the lake—produces the finest <i>caoutchouc</i>.
There the India-rubber tree, of more than one
species, flourishes in abundance; and the true “seringa,”
that yields the finest and most valuable kind of this
gummy juice, is nowhere found in greater perfection
than in the forests of Maracaibo. The caoutchouc of
commerce is obtained from many other parts of America,
as well as from other tropical countries; but as many
of the bottles and shoes so well known in the india-rubber
shops, are manufactured by the Indians of Maracaibo,
we may not find a more appropriate place to give
an account of this singular production, and the mode by
which it is prepared for the purposes of commerce and
manufacture.</p>

<p class='c016'>As already mentioned, many species of trees yield
india-rubber, most of them belonging either to the order
of the “Morads,” or <i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>. Some are species
of <i>ficus</i>, but both the genera and species are too numerous
to be given here. That which supplies the “bottle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>india-rubber” is a euphorbiaceous plant,—the <i>seringa</i>
above mentioned,—whose proper botanical appellation
is <i>Siphonia elastica</i>. It is a tall, straight, smooth-barked
tree, having a trunk of about a foot in diameter, though
in favorable situations reaching to much larger dimensions.
The process of extracting its sap—out of which
the caoutchouc is manufactured—bears some resemblance
to the tapping of sugar-maples in the forests of
the north.</p>

<p class='c016'>With his small hatchet, or tomahawk, the Indian cuts
a gash in the bark, and inserts into it a little wedge of
wood to keep the sides apart. Just under the gash, he
fixes a small cup-shaped vessel of clay, the clay being
still in a plastic state, so that it may be attached closely
to the bark. Into this vessel the milk-like sap of the
<i>seringa</i> soon commences to run, and keeps on until it
has yielded about the fifth of a pint. This, however, is
not the whole yield of a tree, but only of a single wound;
and it is usual to open a great many gashes, or “taps,”
upon the same trunk, each being furnished with its own
cup or receiver. In from four to six hours the sap ceases
to run.</p>

<p class='c016'>The cups are then detached from the tree, and the
contents of all, poured into a large earthen vessel, are
carried to the place where the process of making the
caoutchouc is to take place,—usually some dry open
spot in the middle of the forest, where a temporary camp
has been formed for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the dwelling of the Indian is at a distance from
where the india-rubber tree grows,—as is the case with
those of Lake Maracaibo,—it will not do to transport
the sap thither. There must be no delay after the cups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>are filled, and the process of manufacture must proceed
at once, or as soon as the milky juice begins to coagulate,—which
it does almost on the instant.</p>

<p class='c016'>Previous to reaching his camp, the “seringero” has
provided a large quantity of palm-nuts, with which he
intends to make a fire for smoking the caoutchouc.
These nuts are the fruit of several kinds of palms, but
the best are those afforded by two magnificent species,—the
“Inaja” (<i>Maximiliana regia</i>), and the “Urucuri”
(<i>Attalea excelsa</i>).</p>

<p class='c016'>A fire is kindled of these nuts; and an earthen pot,
with a hole in the bottom, is placed mouth downward
over the pile. Through the aperture now rises a strong
pungent smoke.</p>

<p class='c016'>If it is a shoe that is intended to be made, a clay last
is already prepared, with a stick standing out of the top
of it, to serve as a handle, while the operation is going
on. Taking the stick in his hand, the seringero dips the
last lightly into the milk, or with a cup pours the fluid
gently over it, so as to give a regular coating to the
whole surface; and then, holding it over the smoke, he
keeps turning it, jack-fashion, till the fluid has become
dry and adhesive. Another dip is then given, and the
smoking done as before; and this goes on, till forty or
fifty different coats have brought the sides and soles of
the shoe to a proper thickness. The soles, requiring
greater weight, are, of course, oftener dipped than the
“upper leather.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The whole process of making the shoe does not occupy
half an hour; but it has afterwards to receive some farther
attention in the way of ornament; the lines and
figures are yet to be executed, and this is done about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>two days after the smoking process. They are simply
traced out with a piece of smooth wire, or oftener with
the spine obtained from some tree,—as the thorny point
of the <i>bromelia</i> leaf.</p>

<p class='c016'>In about a week the shoes are ready to be taken from
the last; and this is accomplished at the expense and
utter ruin of the latter, which is broken into fragments,
and then cleaned out. Water is used sometimes to soften
the last, and the inner surface of the shoe is washed after
the clay has been taken out.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bottles are made precisely in the same manner,—a
round ball, or other shaped mass of clay, serving as the
mould for their construction. It requires a little more
trouble to get the mould extracted from the narrow neck
of the bottle.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be remarked that it is not the smoke of the
palm-nuts that gives to the india-rubber its peculiar dark
color; that is the effect of age. When freshly manufactured,
it is still of a whitish or cream color; and only
attains the dark hue after it has been kept for a considerable
time.</p>

<p class='c016'>We might add many other particulars about the mode
in which the Indian of Maracaibo employs his time, but
perhaps enough has been said to show that his existence
is altogether an <i>odd</i> one.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c013'>THE ESQUIMAUX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>The Esquimaux are emphatically an “odd people,”
perhaps the oddest upon the earth. The peculiar character
of the regions they inhabit has naturally initiated
them into a system of habits and modes of life different
from those of any other people on the face of the globe;
and from the remoteness and inaccessibility of the countries
in which they dwell, not only have they remained
an unmixed people, but scarce any change has taken
place in their customs and manners during the long
period since they were first known to civilized nations.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Esquimaux people have been long known and
their habits often described. Our first knowledge of
them was obtained from Greenland,—for the native
inhabitants of Greenland are true Esquimaux,—and
hundreds of years ago accounts of them were given to
the world by the Danish colonists and missionaries—as
also by the whalers who visited the coasts of that
inhospitable land. In later times they have been made
familiar to us through the Arctic explorers and whale-fishers,
who have traversed the labyrinth of icy islands
that extend northward from the continent of America.
The Esquimaux may boast of possessing the <i>longest</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>country in the world. In the first place, Greenland is
theirs, and they are found along the western shores of
Baffin’s Bay. In North America proper their territory
commences at the straits of Belle Isle, which separate
Newfoundland from Labrador, and thence extends all
around the shore of the Arctic Ocean, not only to Behring’s
Straits, but beyond these, around the Pacific coast
of Russian America, as far south as the great mountain
St. Elias. Across Behring’s Straits they are found occupying
a portion of the Asiatic coast, under the name
of Tchutski, and some of the islands in the northern
angle of the Pacific Ocean are also inhabited by these
people, though under a different name. Furthermore,
the numerous ice islands which lie between North
America and the Pole are either inhabited or visited
by Esquimaux to the highest point that discovery has
yet reached.</p>

<p class='c016'>There can be little doubt that the Laplanders of
northern Europe, and the Samoyedes, and other littoral
peoples dwelling along the Siberian shores, are kindred
races of the Esquimaux; and taking this view of the
question, it may be said that the latter possess all the
line of coast of both continents facing northward; in
other words, that their country extends around the
globe—though it cannot be said (as is often boastingly
declared of the British empire) that “the sun
never sets upon it;” for, over the “empire” of the
Esquimaux, the sun not only sets, but remains out of
sight of it for months at a time.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not usual, however, to class the Laplanders and
<i>Asiatic Arctic</i> people with the Esquimaux. There are
some essential points of difference; and what is here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>said of the Esquimaux relates only to those who inhabit
the northern coasts and islands of America, and
to the native Greenlanders.</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding the immense extent of territory thus
designated, notwithstanding the sparseness of the Esquimaux
population, and the vast distances by which one
little tribe or community is separated from another, the
absolute similarity in their habits, in their physical and
intellectual conformation, and, above all, in their languages,
proves incontestably that they are all originally
of one and the same race.</p>

<p class='c016'>Whatever, therefore, may be said of a “Schelling,”
or native Greenlander, will be equally applicable to an
Esquimaux of Labrador, to an Esquimaux of the Mackenzie
River or Bhering’s Straits, or we might add, to a
a Khadiak islander, or a Tuski of the opposite Asiatic
coast; always taking into account such differences of
costume, dialect, modes of life, &amp;c., as may be brought
about by the different circumstances in which they are
placed. In all these things, however, they are wonderfully
alike; their dresses, weapons, boats, houses, and
house implements, being almost the same in material
and construction from East Greenland to the Tchutskoi
Noss.</p>

<p class='c016'>If their country be the longest in the world, it is also
the <i>narrowest</i>. Of course, if we take into account the
large islands that thickly stud the Arctic Ocean, it may
be deemed broad enough; but I am speaking rather
of the territory which they possess on the continents.
This may be regarded as a mere strip following the
outline of the coast, and never extending beyond the
distance of a day’s journey inland. Indeed, they only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>seek the interior in the few short weeks of summer, for
the purpose of hunting the reindeer, the musk-ox, and
other animals; after each excursion, returning again to
the shores of the sea, where they have their winter houses
and more permanent home. They are, truly
and emphatically, a <i>littoral</i> people, and it is to the sea
they look for their principal means of support. But
for this source of supply, they could not long continue
to exist upon land altogether incapable of supplying
the wants even of the most limited population.</p>

<p class='c016'>The name <i>Esquimaux</i>—or, as it is sometimes written,
“Eskimo,”—like many other national appellations,
is of obscure origin. It is supposed to have
been given to them by the Canadian voyageurs in the
employ of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and derived
from the words <i>Ceux qui miaux</i> (those who mew), in
relation to their screaming like cats. But the etymology
is, to say the least, <i>suspicious</i>. They generally call
themselves “Inuit” (pronounced enn-oo-eet), a word
which signifies “men;”—though different tribes of
them have distinct tribal appellations.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/164.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c020'>In personal appearance, they cannot be regarded as
at all prepossessing—though some of the younger
men and girls, when cleansed of the filth and grease
with which their skin is habitually coated, are far from
ill-looking. Their natural color is not much darker
than that of some of the southern nations of Europe—the
Portuguese, for instance—and the young girls
often have blooming cheeks, and a pleasing expression
of countenance. Their faces are generally of a broad,
roundish shape, the forehead and chin both narrow and
receding, and the cheeks very prominent, though not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>angular. On the contrary, they are rather fat and
round. This prominence of the cheeks gives to their
nose the appearance of being low and flat; and individuals
are often seen with such high cheeks, that a
ruler laid from one to the other would not touch the
bridge of the nose between them!</p>

<p class='c016'>As they grow older their complexion becomes darker,
perhaps from exposure to the climate. Very naturally,
too, both men and women grow uglier, but especially the
latter, some of whom in old age present such a hideous
aspect, that the early Arctic explorers could not help
characterizing them as <i>witches</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The average stature of the Esquimaux is far below that
of European nations, though individuals are sometimes met
with nearly six feet in height. These, however, are rare
exceptions; and an Esquimaux of such proportions would
be a giant among his people. The more common height
is from four feet eight inches to five feet eight; and the
women are still shorter, rarely attaining the standard of
five feet. The shortness of both men and women appears
to be a deficiency in length of limb, for their
bodies are long enough; but, as the Esquimaux is almost
constantly in his canoe, or “kayak,” or upon his
dog-sledge, his legs have but little to do, and are consequently
stunted in their development.</p>

<p class='c016'>A similar peculiarity is presented by the Comanche,
and other Indians of the prairies, and also in the Guachos
and Patagonian Indians, of the South-American Pampas,
who spend most of their time on the backs of their
horses.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Esquimaux have no religion, unless we dignify by
that name a belief in witches, sorcerers, “Shamans,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>good or evil spirits, with some confused notion of a
good and bad place hereafter. Missionary zeal has been
exerted among them almost in vain. They exhibit an
apathetic indifference to the teachings of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c016'>Neither have they any political organization; and in
this respect they differ essentially from most savages
known, the lowest of whom have usually their chiefs and
councils of elders. This absence of all government,
however, is no proof of their being lower in the scale
of civilization than other savages; but, perhaps, rather
the contrary, for the very idea of chiefdom, or government,
is a presumption of the existence of vice among a
people, and the necessity of coercion and repression. To
one another these rude people are believed to act in the
most honest manner; and it could be shown that such
was likewise their behavior towards strangers until they
were corrupted by excessive temptation. All Arctic
voyagers record instances of what they term petty theft,
on the part of certain tribes of Esquimaux,—that is,
the pilfering of nails, hatchets, pieces of iron-hoops, &amp;c.,—but
it might be worth while reflecting that these
articles are, in the eyes of the Esquimaux, what ingots
of gold are to Europeans, and worth while inquiring
if a few bars of the last-mentioned metal were laid
loosely and carelessly upon the pavements of London,
how long they would be in changing their owners? Theft
should be regarded along with the amount of temptation;
and it appears even in these recorded cases that only a
<i>few</i> of the Esquimaux took part in it. I apprehend
that something more than a few Londoners would be
found picking up the golden ingots. How many thieves
have we among us, with no greater temptation than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>a cheap cotton kerchief?—more than a few, it is to be
feared.</p>

<p class='c016'>In truth, the Esquimaux are by no means the savages
they have been represented. The only important point
in which they at all assimilate to the purely savage state
is in the filthiness of their persons, and perhaps also in the
fact of their eating much of their food (fish and flesh-meat)
in a raw state. For the latter habit, however,
they are partially indebted to the circumstances in which
they are placed—fires or cookery being at times altogether
impossible. They are not the only people who
have been forced to eat raw flesh; and Europeans who
have travelled in that inhospitable country soon get used
to the practice, at the same time getting quite cured of
their <i>dégoût</i> for it.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is certainly not correct to characterize the Esquimaux
as mere <i>savages</i>. On the contrary, they may be
regarded as a civilized people, that is, so far as civilization
is permitted by the rigorous climate in which they
live; and it would be safe to affirm that a colony of the
most polished people in Europe, established as the Esquimaux
are, and left solely to their own resources, would
in a single generation exhibit a civilization not one degree
higher than that now met with among the Esquimaux.
Indeed, the fact is already established: the Danish and
Norwegian colonists of West Greenland, though backed
by constant intercourse with their mother-land, are but
little more civilized than the “Skellings,” who are their
neighbors.</p>

<p class='c016'>In reality, the Esquimaux have made the most of the
circumstances in which they are placed, and continue to
do so. Among them agriculture is impossible, else they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>would long since have taken to it. So too is commerce;
and as to manufactures, it is doubtful whether Europeans
could excel them under like circumstances. Whatever
raw material their country produces, is by them both
strongly and neatly fabricated, as indicated by the surprising
skill with which they make their dresses, their
boats, their implements for hunting and fishing; and in
these accomplishments—the only ones practicable under
their hyperborean heaven—they are perfect adepts. In
such arts civilized Europeans are perfect simpletons to
them, and the theories of fireside speculators, so lately
promulgated in our newspapers, that Sir John Franklin
and his crew could not fail to procure a living where the
simple Esquimaux were able to make a home, betrayed
only ignorance of the condition of these people. In
truth, white men would starve, where the Esquimaux
could live in luxurious abundance, so far superior to ours
is their knowledge both of fishing and the chase. It is a
well-recorded fact, that while our Arctic voyagers, at
their winter stations, provided with good guns, nets,
and every appliance, could but rarely kill a reindeer or
capture a seal, the Esquimaux obtained both in abundance,
and apparently without an effort; and we shall
presently note the causes of their superiority in this
respect.</p>

<p class='c016'>The very dress of the Esquimaux is a proof of their
superiority over other savages. At no season of the
year do they go either naked, or even “ragged.” They
have their changes to suit the seasons,—their summer
dress, and one of a warmer kind for winter. Both are
made in a most complicated manner; and the preparation
of the material, as well as the manner by which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>is put together, prove the Esquimaux women—for they
are alike the tailors and dressmakers—to be among
the best seamstresses in the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>Captain Lyon, one of the most observant of Arctic
voyagers, has given a description of the costume of the
Esquimaux of Savage Island, and those of Repulse Bay,
where he wintered, and his account is so graphic and
minute in details, that it would be idle to alter a word
of his language. His description, with slight differences
in make and material, will answer pretty accurately for
the costume of the whole race.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The clothes of both sexes are principally composed
of fine and well-prepared reindeer pelts; the skins of
bears, seals, wolves, foxes, and marmottes, are also used.
The seal-skins are seldom employed for any part of the
dress except boots and shoes, as being more capable of
resisting water, and of far greater durability than other
leather.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The general winter dress of the men is an ample
outer coat of deer-skin, having no opening in front, and
a large hood, which is drawn over the head at pleasure.
This hood is invariably bordered with white fur from
the thighs of the deer, and thus presents a lively contrast
to the dark face which it encircles. The front or
belly part of the coat is cut off square with the upper
part of the thighs, but behind it is formed into a broad
skirt, rounded at the lower end, which reaches to within
a few inches of the ground. The lower edges and tails
of these dresses are in some cases bordered with bands
of fur of an opposite color to the body; and it is a favorite
ornament to hang a fringe of little strips of skin beneath
the border. The embellishments give a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>pleasing appearance to the dress. It is customary in
blowing weather to tie a piece of skin or cord tight round
the waist of the coat; but in other cases the dress hangs
loose.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Within the covering I have just described is another,
of precisely the same form; but though destitute of ornaments
of leather, it has frequently little strings of beads
hanging to it from the shoulders or small of the back.
This dress is of thinner skin, and acts as a shirt, the
hairy part being placed near the body: it is the in-doors
habit. When walking, the tail is tied up by two strings
to the back, so that it may not incommode the legs. Besides
these two coats, they have also a large cloak, or,
in fact, an open deer-skin, with sleeves: this, from its
size, is more frequently used as a blanket; and I but
once saw it worn by a man at the ship, although the
women throw it over their shoulders to shelter themselves
and children while sitting on the sledge.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The trowsers, which are tightly tied round the loins,
have no waistbands, but depend entirely by the drawing-string;
they are generally of deer-skin, and ornamented
in the same manner as the coats. One of the most
favorite patterns is an arrangement of the skins of deer’s
legs, so as to form very pretty stripes. As with the
jackets, there are two pair of these indispensables,
reaching no lower than the knee-cap, which is a cause
of great distress in cold weather, as that part is frequently
severely frost-bitten; yet, with all their experience
of this bad contrivance, they will not add an inch
to the established length.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The boots reach to the bottom of the breeches, which
hang loosely over them. In these, as in other parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the dress, are many varieties of color, material, and pattern,
yet in shape they never vary. The general winter
boots are of deer-skin; one having the hair next the leg,
and the other with the fur outside. A pair of soft slippers
of the same kind are worn between the two pair of
boots, and outside of all a strong seal-skin shoe is pulled
to the height of the ankle, where it is tightly secured by
a drawing-string. For hunting excursions, or in summer
when the country is thawed, one pair of boots only
is worn. They are of seal-skin, and so well sewed and
prepared without the hair, that although completely saturated,
they allow no water to pass through them. The
soles are generally of the tough hide of the walrus, or
of the large seal called Oō-ghĭoo, so that the feet are
well protected in walking over rough ground. Slippers
are sometimes worn outside. In both cases the boots
are tightly fastened round the instep with a thong of
leather. The mittens in common use are of deer-skin,
with the hair inside; but, in fact, every kind of skin is
used for them. They are extremely comfortable when
dry; but if once wetted and frozen again, in the winter
afford as little protection to the hands as a case of ice
would do. In summer, and in fishing, excellent seal-skin
mittens are used, and have the same power of resisting
water as the boots of which I have just spoken. The
dresses I have just described are chiefly used in winter.
During the summer it is customary to wear coats, boots,
and even breeches, composed of the prepared skins of
ducks, with the feathers next the body. These are comfortable,
light, and easily prepared. The few ornaments
in their possession are worn by the men. These are
some bandeaus which encircle the head, and are composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of various-colored leather, plaited in a mosaic
pattern, and in some cases having human hair woven in
them, as a contrast to the white-skins. From the lower
edge foxes’ teeth hang suspended, arranged as a fringe
across the forehead. Some wear a musk-ox tooth, a bit
of ivory, or a small piece of bone.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The clothing of the women is of the same materials
as that of the men, but in shape almost every part is
different from the male dress. An inner jacket is worn
next the skin, and the fur of the other is outside. The
hind-flap, or tail, is of the same form before described,
but there is also a small flap in front, extending about
half-way down the thigh. The coats have each an immense
hood, which, as well as covering the head, answers
the purpose of a child’s cradle for two or three years
after the birth of an infant. In order to keep the burden
of the child from drawing the dress tight across the
throat, a contrivance, in a great measure resembling the
slings of a soldier’s knapsack, is affixed to the collar or
neck part, whence it passes beneath the hood, crosses,
and, being brought under the arms, is secured on each
side the breast by a wooden button. The shoulders of
the women’s coat have a bag-like space, for the purpose
of facilitating the removal of the child from the hood
round to the breast without taking it out of the jacket.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A girdle is sometimes worn round the waist: it answers
the double purposes of comfort and ornament,
being composed of what they consider valuable trinkets,
such as foxes’ bones (those of the rableeaghioo), or
sometimes of the ears of deer, which hang in pairs to
the number of twenty or thirty, and are trophies of the
skill of the hunter, to whom the wearer is allied. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>inexpressibles of the women are in the same form as
those of the men, but they are not ornamented by the
same curious arrangement of colors; the front part is
generally of white, and the back of dark fur. The
manner of securing them at the waist is also the same;
but the drawing-strings are of much greater length, being
suffered to hang down by one side, and their ends are
frequently ornamented with some pendent jewel, such
as a grinder or two of the musk-ox, a piece of ivory, a
small ball of wood, or a perforated stone.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The boots of the fair sex are, without dispute, the
most extraordinary part of their equipment, and are of
such an immense size as to resemble leather sacks, and
to give a most deformed, and, at the same time, ludicrous
appearance to the whole figure, the bulky part being at
the knee; the upper end is formed into a pointed flap,
which, covering the front of the thigh, is secured by a
button or knot within the waistband of the breeches.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Some of these ample articles of apparel are composed
with considerable taste, of various-colored skins;
they also have them of parchment,—seals’ leather. Two
pairs are worn; and the feet have also a pair of seal-skin
slippers, which fit close, and are tightly tied round
the ankle.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Children have no kind of clothing, but lie naked in
their mothers’ hoods until two or three years of age,
when they are stuffed into a little dress, generally of
fawn-skin, which has jacket and breeches in one, the
back part being open; into these they are pushed, when
a string or two closes all up again. A cap forms an
indispensable part of the equipment, and is generally of
some fantastical shape; the skin of a fawn’s head is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>favorite material in the composition, and is sometimes
seen with the ears perfect; the nose and holes for the
eyes lying along the crown of the wearer’s head, which
in consequence, looks like that of an animal.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The same author also gives a most graphic description
of the curious winter dwellings of the Esquimaux, which
on many parts of the coast are built out of the only
materials to be had,—<i>ice and snow</i>! Snow for the
walls and ice for the windows! you might fancy the
house of the Esquimaux to be a very cold dwelling;
such, however, is by no means its character.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The entrance to the dwellings,” says Captain Lyon,
“was by a hole, about a yard in diameter, which led
through a low-arched passage of sufficient breadth for
two to pass in a stooping posture, and about sixteen feet
in length; another hole then presented itself, and led
through a similarly-shaped, but shorter passage, having
at its termination a round opening, about two feet across.
Up this hole we crept one step, and found ourselves in a
dome about seven feet in height, and as many in diameter,
from whence the three dwelling-places, with arched
roofs, were entered. It must be observed that this is the
description of a large hut, the smaller ones, containing
one or two families, have the domes somewhat differently
arranged.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Each dwelling might be averaged at fourteen or sixteen
feet in diameter by six or seven in height, but as
snow alone was used in their construction, and was
always at hand, it might be supposed that there was
no particular size, that being of course at the option of
the builder. The laying of the arch was performed in such
a manner as would have satisfied the most regular artist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>the key-piece on the top, being a large square slab. The
blocks of snow used in the buildings were from four to
six inches in thickness, and about a couple of feet in
length, carefully pared with a large knife. Where two
families occupied a dome, a seat was raised on either
side, two feet in height. These raised places were used
as beds, and covered in the first place with whalebone,
sprigs of andromeda, or pieces of seals’-skin, over these
were spread deer-pelts and deer-skin clothes, which had
a very warm appearance. The pelts were used as blankets,
and many of them had ornamental fringes of leather
sewed round their edges.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Each dwelling-place was illumined by a broad piece
of transparent fresh-water ice, of about two feet in diameter,
which formed part of the roof, and was placed over
the door. These windows gave a most pleasing light,
free from glare, and something like that which is thrown
through ground glass. We soon learned that the building
of a house was but the work of an hour or two, and
that a couple of men—one to cut the slabs and the
other to lay them—were laborers sufficient.</p>

<p class='c016'>“For the support of the lamps and cooking apparatus,
a mound of snow is erected for each family; and when
the master has two wives or a mother, both have an
independent place, one at each end of the bench.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I find it impossible to attempt describing everything
at a second visit, and shall therefore only give an account
of those articles of furniture which must be always the
same, and with which, in five minutes, any one might be
acquainted. A frame, composed of two or three broken
fishing-spears, supported in the first place a large hoop
of wood or bone, across which an open-meshed and ill-made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>net was spread or worked for the reception of wet
or damp clothes, skins, etc., which could be dried by the
heat of the lamp. On this contrivance the master of
each hut placed his gloves on entering, first carefully
clearing them of snow.</p>

<p class='c016'>“From the frame above mentioned, one or more coffin-shaped
stone pots were suspended over lamps of the
same material, crescent-shaped, and having a ridge
extending along their back; the bowl part was filled
with blubber, and the oil and wicks were ranged close
together along the edge. The wicks were made of moss
and trimmed by a piece of asbestos, stone, or wood; near
at hand a large bundle of moss was hanging for a future
supply. The lamps were supported by sticks, bones, or
pieces of horn, at a sufficient height to admit an oval pot
of wood or whalebone beneath, in order to catch any oil
that might drop from them. The lamps varied considerably
in size, from two feet to six inches in length, and
the pots were equally irregular, holding from two or
three gallons to half a pint. Although I have mentioned
a kind of scaffolding, these people did not all possess so
grand an establishment, many being contented to suspend
their pot to a piece of bone stuck in the wall of the hut.
One young woman was quite a caricature in this way:
she was the inferior wife of a young man, whose senior
lady was of a large size, and had a corresponding lamp,
etc., at one corner; while she herself, being short and
fat, had a lamp the size of half a dessert-plate, and a pot
which held a pint only.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Almost every family was possessed of a large wooden
tray, resembling those used by butchers in England;
its offices, however, as we soon perceived, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>more various, some containing raw flesh of seals and
blubber, and others, skins, which were steeping in urine.
A quantity of variously-sized bowls of whalebone, wood,
or skin, completed the list of vessels, and it was evident
that they were made to contain <i>anything</i>.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Esquimaux use two kinds of boats,—the “oomiak”
and “kayak.” The oomiak is merely a large
species of punt, used exclusively by the women; but the
kayak is a triumph in the art of naval architecture, and
is as elegant as it is ingenious. It is about twenty-five
feet in length, and less than two in breadth of beam. In
shape it has been compared to a weaver’s shuttle, though
it tapers much more elegantly than this piece of machinery.
It is decked from stem to stern, excepting a
circular hole very nearly amidships, and this round hatch-way
is just large enough to admit the body of an Esquimaux
in a sitting posture. Around the rim of the circle
is a little ridge, sometimes higher in front than at the
back, and this ridge is often ornamented with a hoop of
ivory. A flat piece of wood runs along each side of the
frame, and is, in fact, the only piece of any strength in a
kayak. Its depth in the centre is four or five inches, and
its thickness about three fourths of an inch; it tapers to
a point at the commencement of the stem and stern projections.
Sixty-four ribs are fastened to this gunwale
piece; seven slight rods run the whole length of the bottom
and outside the ribs. The bottom is rounded, and
has no keel; twenty-two little beams or cross-pieces keep
the frame on a stretch above, and one strong batten runs
along the centre, from stem to stern, being, of course, discontinued
at the seat part. The ribs are made of ground
willow, also of whalebone, or, if it can be procured, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>good-grained wood. The whole contrivance does not
weigh over fifty or sixty pounds; so that a man easily
carries his kayak on his head, which, by the form of the
rim, he can do without the assistance of his hands.</p>

<p class='c016'>An Esquimaux prides himself in the neat appearance
of his boat, and has a warm skin placed in its bottom to
sit on. His posture with the legs pointed forward, and
he cannot change his position without the assistance of
another person; in all cases where a weight is to be
lifted, an alteration of stowage, or any movement to be
made, it is customary for two kayaks to lie together; and
the paddle of each being placed across the other, they
form a steady double boat. An inflated seal’s bladder
forms, invariably, part of the equipage of a canoe, and
the weapons are confined in their places by small lines
of whalebone, stretched tightly across the upper covering,
so as to receive the points or handles of the spears
beneath them. Flesh is frequently stowed within the
stem or stern, as are also birds and eggs; but a seal, although
round, and easily made to roll, is so neatly balanced
on the upper part of the boat as seldom to require
a lashing. When Esquimaux are not paddling, their balance
must be nicely preserved, and a trembling motion is
always observable in the boat. The most difficult position
for managing a kayak is when going before the wind,
and with a little swell running. Any inattention would
instantly, by exposing the broadside, overturn this frail
vessel. The dexterity with which they are turned, the
velocity of their way, and the extreme elegance of form
of the kayaks, render an Esquimaux of the highest interest
when sitting independently, and urging his course towards
his prey.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“The paddle is double-bladed, nine feet three inches
in length, small at the grasp, and widening to four inches
at the blades, which are thin, and edged with ivory for
strength as well as ornament.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The next object of importance to the boat is the
sledge, which finds occupation during at least three
fourths of the year. A man who possesses both this
and a canoe is considered a person of property. To
give a particular description of the sledge would be impossible,
as there are no two actually alike; and the materials
of which they are composed are as various as
their form. The best are made of the jaw-bones of the
whale, sawed to about two inches in thickness, and in
depth from six inches to a foot. These are the runners,
and are shod with a thin plank of the same material;
the side-pieces are connected by means of bones, pieces
of wood, or deers’ horns, lashed across, with a few inches
space between each, and they yield to any great strain
which the sledge may receive. The general breadth of
the upper part of the sledge is about twenty inches; but
the runners lean inwards, and therefore at bottom it is
rather greater. The length of bone sledges is from four
feet to fourteen. Their weight is necessarily great; and
one of moderate size, that is to say, about ten or twelve
feet, was found to be two hundred and seventeen pounds.
The skin of the walrus is very commonly used during
the coldest part of the winter, as being hard-frozen, and
resembling an inch board, with ten time the strength, for
runners. Another ingenious contrivance is, by casing moss
and earth in seal’s skin, so that by pouring a little water
a round hard bolster is easily formed. Across all these
kinds of runners there is the same arrangement of bones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>sticks, &amp;c., on the upper part; and the surface which
passes over the snow is coated with ice, by mixing snow
with fresh water, which assists greatly in lightening the
load for the dogs, as it slides forwards with ease. Boys
frequently amuse themselves by yoking several dogs to a
small piece of seal’s skin, and sitting on it, holding by
the traces. Their plan is then to set off at full speed,
and he who bears the greatest number of bumps before
he relinquishes his hold is considered a very fine fellow.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Esquimaux possess various kinds of spears, but
their difference is chiefly in consequence of the substances
of which they are composed, and not in their
general form.</p>

<p class='c016'>“One called kā-tĕ-tēek, is a large and strong-handled
spear, with an ivory point made for despatching any
wounded animal in the water. It is never thrown, but
has a place appropriated for it on the kayak.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The oonak is a lighter kind than the former; also
ivory-headed. It has a bladder fastened to it, and has a
loose head with a line attached; this being darted into
an animal, is instantly liberated from the handle which
gives the impetus. Some few of these weapons are constructed
of the solid ivory of the unicorn’s horn, about
four feet in length, and remarkably well rounded and
polished.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ip-pŏo-tōo-yŏo, is another kind of hand-spear, varying
but little from the one last described. It has, however,
no appendages.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Noōgh-wit is of two kinds; but both are used for
striking birds, young animals, or fish. The first has a
double fork at the extremity, and there are three other
barbed ones at about half its length, diverging in different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>directions, so that if the end pair should miss, some
of the centre ones might strike. The second kind has
only three barbed forks at the head. All the points are
of ivory, and the natural curve of the walrus tusk favors
and facilitates their construction.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Amongst the minor instruments of the ice-hunting
are a long bone feeler for plumbing any cracks through
which seals are suspected of breathing, and also for trying
the safety of the road. Another contrivance is occasionally
used with the same effect as the float of a fishing-line.
Its purpose is to warn the hunter, who is watching
a seal-hole, when the animal rises to the surface, so that
he may strike without seeing, or being seen, by his prey.
This is a most delicate little rod of bone or ivory, of
about a foot in length, and the thickness of a fine knitting-needle.
At the lower end is a small knob like a
pin’s head, and the upper extremity has a fine piece of
sinew tied to it, so as to fasten it loosely to the side of
the hole. The animal, on rising, does not perceive so
small an object hanging in the water, and pushes it up
with his nose, when the watchful Esquimaux, observing
his little beacon in motion, strikes down, and secures his
prize.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Small ivory pegs or pins are used to stop the holes
made by the spears in the animal’s body; thus the blood,
a great luxury to the natives, is saved.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The same want of wood which renders it necessary
to find substitutes in the construction of spears, also occasions
the great variety of bows. The horn of the
musk-ox, thinned horns of deer, or other bony substances,
are as frequently used or met with as wood, in the manufacture
of these weapons, in which elasticity is a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>secondary consideration. Three or four pieces of horn
or wood are frequently joined together in one bow,—the
strength lying alone in a vast collection of small
plaited sinews; these, to the number of perhaps a hundred,
run down the back of the bow, and being quite
tight, and having the spring of catgut, cause the weapon,
when unstrung, to turn the wrong way; when bent, their
united strength and elasticity are amazing. The bow-string
is of fifteen to twenty plaits, each loose from the
other, but twisted round when in use, so that a few additional
turns will at any time alter its length. The
general length of the bows is about three feet and a
half.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The arrows are short, light, and formed according to
no general rule as to length or thickness. A good one
has half the shaft of bone, and a head of hard slate, or
a small piece of iron; others have sharply-pointed bone
heads: none are barbed. Two feathers are used for
the end, and are tied opposite each other, with the flat
sides parallel. A neatly-formed case contains the bow
and a few arrows. Seal-skin is preferred for this purpose,
as more effectually resisting the wet than any other.
A little bag, which is attached to the side, contains a stone
for sharpening, and some spare arrow-heads carefully
wrapped up in a piece of skin.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The bow is held in a horizontal position, and though
capable of great force, is rarely used at a greater distance
than from twelve to twenty yards.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Their houses, clothing, sledges, boats, utensils, and
arms, being now described, it only remains to be seen
in what manner these most singular people pass their
time, how they supply themselves with food, and how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>they manage to support life during the long dark winter
and the scarce less hospitable summer of their rigorous
clime. Their occupations from year to year are carried
on with an almost unvarying regularity, though, like
their dresses, they change according to the season.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their short summer is chiefly employed in hunting the
reindeer, and other quadrupeds,—for the simple reason
that it is at this season that these appear in greatest numbers
among them, migrating northward as the snow thaws
from the valleys and hill-sides. Not but that they also
kill the reindeer in other seasons, for these animals do
not all migrate southward on the approach of winter,
a considerable number remaining all the year upon the
shores of the Arctic Sea, as well as the islands to the
north of them. Of course, the Esquimaux kills a reindeer
when and where he can; and it may be here remarked,
that in no part of the American continent has
the reindeer been trained or domesticated as among the
Laplanders and the people of Russian Asia. Neither
the Northern Indians (Tinné) nor the Esquimaux have
ever reached this degree in domestic civilization, and
this fact is one of the strongest points of difference between
the American Esquimaux and their kindred races
in the north of Asia. One tribe of true Esquimaux
alone hold the reindeer in subjection, viz. the Tuski,
already mentioned, on the Asiatic shore; and it might
easily be shown that the practice reached them from the
contiguous countries of northern Asia. The American
Esquimaux, like those of Greenland, possess only the
dog as a domesticated animal; and him they have trained
to draw their sledges in a style that exhibits the highest
order of skill, and even elegance. The Esquimaux dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>is too well known to require particular description. He
is often brought to this country in the return ships of
Arctic whalers and voyagers; and his thick, stout body
covered closely with long stiff hair of a whitish or yellowish
color, his cocked ears and smooth muzzle, and,
above all, the circle-like curling of his bushy tail, will
easily be remembered by any one who has ever seen
this valuable animal.</p>

<p class='c016'>In summer, then, the Esquimaux desert their winter
houses upon the shore, and taking with them their tents
make an excursion into the interior. They do not go
far from the sea—no farther than is necessary to find
the valleys browsed by the reindeer, and the fresh-water
lakes, which, at this season, are frequented by flocks of
swans, geese of various kinds, ducks, and other aquatic
birds. Hunting the reindeer forms their principal occupation
at this time; but, of course, “all is fish that
comes into the net” of an Esquimaux; and they also
employ themselves in capturing the wild fowl and the
fresh-water fish, in which these lakes abound. With
the wild fowl it is the breeding and moulting season,
and the Esquimaux not only rob them of their eggs,
but take large numbers of the young before they are
sufficiently fledged to enable them to fly, and also the
old ones while similarly incapacitated from their condition
of “moult.” In their swift kayaks which they
have carried with them on their heads, they can pursue
the fluttering flocks over any part of a lake, and
overtake them wherever they may go. This is a season
of great plenty in the larder of the <i>Inuit</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The fresh-water fish are struck with spears out of
the kayaks, or, when there is ice on the water strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>enough to bear the weight of a man, the fish are captured
in a different manner. A hole is broken in the
ice, the broken fragments are skimmed off and cast
aside, and then the fisherman lets down a shining bauble—usually
the white tooth of some animal—to act
as a bait. This he keeps bobbing about until the fish,
perceiving it afar off through the translucent water,
usually approaches to reconnoitre, partly from curiosity,
but more, perhaps, to see if it be anything to eat.
When near enough the Esquimaux adroitly pins the
victim with his fish-spear, and lands it upon the ice.
This species of fishing is usually delivered over to the
boys—the time of the hunters being too valuable to be
wasted in waiting for the approach of the fish to the
decoy, an event of precarious and uncertain occurrence.</p>

<p class='c016'>In capturing the reindeer, the Esquimaux practises
no method very different from that used by “still hunters”
in other parts of America. He has to depend
alone upon his bow and arrows, but with these poor
weapons he contrives to make more havoc among a
herd of deer than would a backwoods hunter with his
redoubtable rifle. There is no mystery about his superior
management. It consists simply in the exhibition
of the great strategy and patience with which he makes
his approaches, crawling from point to point and using
every available cover which the ground may afford.</p>

<p class='c016'>But all this would be of little avail were it not for a
<i>ruse</i> which he puts in practice, and which brings the
unsuspecting deer within reach of his deadly arrows.
This consists in a close imitation of the cries of the
animal, so close that the sharp-eared creature itself cannot
detect the counterfeit, but, drawing nearer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>nearer to the rock or bush from which the call appears
to proceed, falls a victim to the deception. The
silent arrow makes no audible sound; the herd, if
slightly disturbed at seeing one of their number fall,
soon compose themselves, and go on browsing upon
the grass or licking up the lichen. Another is attracted
by the call, and another, who fall in their turn
victims either to their curiosity or the instinct of amorous
passions.</p>

<p class='c016'>For this species of hunting, the bow far excels any
other weapon; even the rifle is inferior to it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sometimes the Esquimaux take the deer in large
numbers, by hunting them with dogs, driving the herd
into some defile or <i>cul de sac</i> among the rocks, and
then killing them at will with their arrows and javelins.
This, however, is an exceptional case, as such
natural “pounds” are not always at hand. The Indians
farther south construct artificial enclosures; but
in the Esquimaux country there is neither time nor
material for such elaborate contrivances.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Esquimaux who dwell in those parts frequented
by the musk-oxen, hunt these animals very much as
they do the reindeer; but killing a musk bull, or cow
either, is a feat of far grander magnitude, and requires
more address than shooting a tiny deer.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have said that the Esquimaux do not, even in
these hunting excursions, stray very far into the interior.
There is a good reason for their keeping close
to the seashore. Were they to penetrate far into the
land they would be in danger of meeting with their
bitter foemen, the <i>Tinné</i> Indians, who in this region
also hunt reindeer and musk-oxen. War to the knife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>is the practice between these two races of people, and
has ever been since the first knowledge of either.
They often meet in conflict upon the rivers inland,
and these conflicts are of so cruel and sanguinary a
nature as to imbue each with a wholesome fear of the
other. The Indians, however, dread the Esquimaux
more than the latter fear them; and up to a late
period took good care never to approach their coasts;
but the musket and rifle have now got into the hands
of some of the northern tribes, who avail themselves
of these superior weapons, not only to keep the Esquimaux
at bay, but also to render them more cautious
about extending their range towards the interior.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the dreary winter begins to make its appearance,
and the reindeer grow scarce upon the snow-covered
plains, the Esquimaux return to their winter
villages upon the coast. Quadrupeds and birds no
longer occupy their whole attention, for the drift of
their thoughts is now turned towards the inhabitants
of the great deep. The seal and the walrus are henceforth
the main objects of pursuit. Perhaps during the
summer, when the water was open, they may have
visited the shore for the purpose of capturing that
great giant of the icy seas—a whale. If so, and they
have been successful in only one or two captures, they
may look forward to a winter of plenty—since the
flesh of a full-grown whale, or, better still, a brace of
such ample creatures, would be sufficient to feed a
whole tribe for months.</p>

<p class='c016'>They have no curing process for this immense carcass;
they stand in need of none. Neither salt nor smoking is
required in their climate. Jack Frost is their provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>curer, and performs the task without putting them either
to trouble or expense. It is only necessary for them to
hoist the great flitches upon scaffolds, already erected
for the purpose, so as to keep the meat from the wolves,
wolverines, foxes, and their own half-starved dogs. From
their aërial larder they can cut a piece of blubber whenever
they feel hungry, or they have a mind to eat, and
this <i>mind</i> they are in so long as a morsel is left.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their mode of capturing a whale is quite different from
that practised by the whale-fishers. When the huge
creature is discovered near, the whole tribe sally forth,
and surround it in their kayaks; they then hurl darts
into its body, but instead of these having long lines attached
to them, they are provided with seal skins sewed
up air-tight and inflated, like bladders. When a number
of these become attached to the body of the whale, the
animal, powerful though he be, finds great difficulty in
sinking far down, or even progressing rapidly through
the water. He soon rises to the surface, and the seal-skin
buoys indicate his whereabouts to the occupants of
the kayaks, who in their swift little crafts, soon dart up
to him again, and shoot a fresh volley into his body. In
this way the whale is soon “wearied out,” and then falls
a victim to their larger spears, just as in the case where
a capture is made by regular whalers.</p>

<p class='c016'>I need scarcely add that a success of this kind is hailed
as a jubilee of the tribe, since it not only brings a benefit
to the whole community, but is also a piece of fortune of
somewhat rare occurrence.</p>

<p class='c016'>When no whales have been taken, the long, dark winter
may justly be looked forward to with some solicitude;
and it is then that the Esquimaux requires to put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>forth all his skill and energies for the capture of the walrus
or the seal—the latter of which may be regarded as
the staff of his life, furnishing him not only with food,
but with light, fuel, and clothing for his body and limbs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of the seals that inhabit the Polar Seas there are several
species; but the common seal (<i>Calocephalus vitulina</i>)
and the harp-seal (<i>C. Grœnlandicus</i>) are those
most numerous, and consequently the principal object of
pursuit.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Esquimaux uses various stratagems for taking
these creatures, according to the circumstances in which
they may be encountered; and simpletons as the seals
may appear, they are by no means easy of capture.
They are usually very shy and suspicious, even in places
where man has never been seen by them. They have
other enemies, especially in the great polar bear; and
the dread of this tyrant of the icy seas keeps them ever
on the alert. Notwithstanding their watchfulness, however,
both the bear and the biped make great havoc
among them, and each year hundreds of thousands of
them are destroyed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The bear, in capturing seals, exhibits a skill and cunning
scarce excelled by that of the rational being himself.
When this great quadruped perceives a seal basking
on the edge of an ice-field, he makes his approaches,
not by rushing directly towards it, which he well knows
would defeat his purpose. If once seen by the seal, the
latter has only to betake himself to the water, where it
can soon sink or swim beyond the reach of the bear. To
prevent this, the bear gets well to leeward, and then diving
below the surface, makes his approaches under water,
now and then cautiously raising his head to get the true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>bearings of his intended victim. After a number of
these subaqueous “reaches,” he gets close in to the edge
of the floe in such a position as to cut off the seal’s retreat
to the water. A single spring brings him on the
ice, and then, before the poor seal has time to make a
brace of flounders, it finds itself locked in the deadly embrace
of the bear. When seals are thus detected asleep,
the Esquimaux approaches them in his kayak, taking
care to paddle cautiously and silently. If he succeed in
getting between them and the open water, he kills them in
the ordinary way—by simply knocking them on the snout
with a club, or piercing them with a spear. Sometimes,
however, the seal goes to sleep on the surface of the open
water. Then the approach is made in a similar manner
by means of the kayak, and the animal is struck with a
harpoon. But a single blow does not always kill a seal,
especially if it be a large one, and the blow has been ill-directed.
In such cases the animal would undoubtedly
make his escape, and carry the harpoon along with it,
which would be a serious loss to the owner, who does not
obtain such weapons without great difficulty. To prevent
this, the Esquimaux uses a contrivance similar to
that employed in the capture of the whale,—that is, he
attaches a float or buoy to his harpoon by means of a cord,
and this so impedes the passage of the seal through the
water, that it can neither dive nor swim to any very great
distance. The float is usually a walrus bladder inflated
in the ordinary way, and wherever the seal may go, the
float betrays its track, enabling the Esquimaux to follow
it in his shuttle-shaped kayak, and pierce it again with a
surer aim.</p>

<p class='c016'>In winter, when the sea is quite covered with ice, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>might fancy that the seal-fishery would be at an end, for
the seal is essentially a marine animal; and although it
can exist upon the ice or on dry land, it could not <i>subsist</i>
there. Access to the water it must have, in order to
procure its food, which consists of small fish and mollusks.
Of course, when the ice forms on the surface, the
seal is in its true element—the water underneath—but
when this ice becomes, as it often does, a full yard in
thickness, extending over hundreds of miles of the sea,
how then is the seal to be got at? It could not be
reached at all; and at such a season the Esquimaux
people would undoubtedly starve, were it not for a habit
peculiar to this animal, which, happily for them, brings
it within their reach.</p>

<p class='c016'>Though the seal can live under water like a fish, and
probably could pass a whole winter under the ice without
much inconvenience, it likes now and then to take a little
fresh air, and have a quiet nap upon the upper surface in
the open air. With this design it breaks a hole through
the ice, while the latter is yet thin, and this hole it keeps
carefully open during the whole winter, clearing out each
new crust as it forms. No matter to what thickness the
ice may attain, this hole always forms a breathing-place
for the seal, and a passage by which he may reach the
upper surface, and indulge himself in his favorite siesta
in the open air. Knowing this habit, the Esquimaux
takes advantage of it to make the seal his captive. When
the animal is discovered on the ice, the hunter approaches
with the greatest stealth and caution. This is absolutely
neccessary: for if the enemy is perceived, or makes the
slightest noise, the wary seal flounders rapidly into his
hole, and is lost beyond redemption. If badly frightened,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>he will not appear for a long time, denying himself his
open air exercise until the patience of his persecutor is
quite worn out, and the coast is again clear.</p>

<p class='c016'>In making his approaches, the hunter uses all his art,
not only taking advantage of every inequality—such as
snow-drifts and ice-hillocks—to conceal himself; but
he also practises an ingenious deception by dressing himself
in the skin of a seal of like species, giving his body
the figure of the animal, and counterfeiting its motions,
by floundering clumsily over the ice, and oscillating his
head from side to side, just as seals are seen to do.</p>

<p class='c016'>This deception often proves successful, when the hunter
under any other shape would in vain endeavor to get
within striking distance of his prey. When seals are
scarce, and the supply greatly needed, the Esquimaux
often lies patiently for hours together on the edge of a
seal-hole waiting for the animal to come up. In order
to give it time to get well out upon the ice, the hunter
conceals himself behind a heap of snow, which he has
collected and piled up for the purpose. A float-stick,
ingeniously placed in the water of the breathing-hole,
serves as a signal to tell when the seal is mounting
through his trap-like passage, the motion of the stick
betraying its ascent. The hunter then gets himself into
the right attitude to strike, and summons all his energies
for the encounter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Even during the long, dark night of winter this mode
of capturing the seal is practised. The hunter, having
discovered a breathing-hole—which its dark color enables
him to find—proceeds in the following manner:
he scrapes away the snow from around it, and lifting up
some water pours it on the ice, so as to make a circle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of a darker hue around the orifice. He then makes a
sort of cake of pure white snow, and with this covers
the hole as with a lid. In the centre of this lid he
punches a small opening with the shaft-end of his spear,
and then sits down and patiently awaits the issue.</p>

<p class='c016'>The seal ascends unsuspiciously as before. The dark
water, bubbling up through the small central orifice,
betrays its approach, which can be perceived even in
the darkest night. The hunter does not wait for its
climbing out upon the ice. Perhaps if he did so, the
suspicious creature might detect the device, and dive
down again. But it is not allowed time for reflection.
Before it can turn its unwieldly body, the heavy spear
of the hunter—struck through the yielding snow—descends
upon its skull, and kills it on the instant.</p>

<p class='c016'>The great “walrus” or “morse” (<i>Trichecus rosmarus</i>)
is another important product of the Polar Seas, and
is hunted by the Esquimaux with great assiduity. This
splendid amphibious animal is taken by contrivances
very similar to those used for the seal; but the capture
of a walrus is an event of importance, second only to the
striking of a whale. Its great carcass not only supplies
food to a whole village, but an oil superior to that of the
whale, besides various other useful articles. Its skin,
bones, and intestines are employed by the Esquimaux
for many domestic purposes,—and, in addition, there
are the huge molar tusks, that furnish one of the most
valuable ivories of commerce, from which are manufactured
those beautiful sets of teeth, of dazzling whiteness,
that, gleaming between vermilion lips, you may often
see at a ball or an evening party!</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE TONGANS, OR FRIENDLY ISLANDERS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>It is a pleasure to pass out of the company of the
ferocious Feegees into that of another people, which,
though near neighbors of the former, are different from
them in almost every respect,—I mean the Tongans,
or Friendly Islanders. This appellation scarce requires
to be explained. Every one knows that it was bestowed
upon them by the celebrated navigator Cook,—who although
not the actual discoverer of the Tonga group
was the first who thoroughly explored these islands, and
gave any reliable account of them to the civilized world.
Tasman, who might be termed the “Dutch Captain
Cook,” is allowed to be their discoverer, so long ago
as 1643; though there is reason to believe that some of
the Spanish explorers from Peru may have touched at
these islands before his time. Tasman, however, has
fixed the record of his visit, and is therefore entitled to
the credit of the discovery,—as he is also to that of
Australia, New Zealand, Van Diemen’s Land, and other
now well-known islands of the Southwestern Pacific.
Tasman bestowed upon three of the Tonga group the
names—Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Middleburgh; but,
fortunately, geographers have acted in this matter with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>better taste than is their wont; and Tasman’s Dutch
national titles have fallen into disuse,—while the true
native names of the islands have been restored to the
map. This is what should be done with other Pacific
islands as well; for it is difficult to conceive anything
in worse taste than such titles as the Caroline and Loyalty
Isles, Prince William’s Land, King George’s Island,
and the ten thousand Albert and Victoria Lands which
the genius of flattery, or rather flunkeyism, has so liberally
distributed over the face of the earth. The title
of Friendly Isles, bestowed by Cook upon the Tonga
archipelago, deserves to live; since it is not only appropriate,
but forms the record of a pleasant fact,—the
pacific character of our earliest intercourse with these
interesting people.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be here remarked, that Mr. Wylde and other
superficial map-makers have taken a most unwarrantable
liberty with this title. Instead of leaving it as bestowed
by the great navigator,—applicable to the Tonga archipelago
alone,—they have <i>stretched</i> it to include that of
the Samoans, and—would it be believed—that of the
<i>Feegees</i>? It is hardly necessary to point out the extreme
absurdity of such a classification: since it would be difficult
to find two nationalities much more unlike than
those of Tonga and Feegee. That they have many customs
in common, is due (unfortunately for the Tongans)
to the intercourse which proximity has produced; but
in an ethnological sense, white is not a greater contrast
to black, nor good to evil, than that which exists between
a Tongan and a Feegeean. Cook never visited the
Feegee archipelago,—he only saw some of these people
while at Tonga-taboo, and heard of their country as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>being <i>a large island</i>. Had he visited that island,—or
rather that group of over two hundred islands,—it is
not at all likely he would have seen reason to extend to
them the title which the map-makers have thought fit to
bestow. Instead of “Friendly Islands,” he might by
way of contrast have called them the “Hostile Isles,” or
given them that—above all others most appropriate,
and which they truly deserve to bear—that old title
celebrated in song! the “Cannibal Islands.” An observer
so acute as Cook could scarce have overlooked
the appropriateness of the appellation.</p>

<p class='c016'>The situation of the Tonga, or Friendly Isles, is
easily registered in the memory. The parallel of 20°
south, and the meridian of 175° west, very nearly intersect
each other in Tofoa, which may be regarded as the
central island of the group. It will thus be seen that
their central point is 5° east and 2° south of the centre
of the Feegeean archipelago, and the nearest islands of
the two groups are about three hundred miles apart.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is worthy of observation, however, that the Tonga
Isles have the advantage, as regards the wind. The
<i>trades</i> are in their favor; and from Tonga to Feegee,
if we employ a landsman’s phraseology, it is “down
hill,” while it is all “up hill” in the contrary direction.
The consequence is, that many Tongans are constantly
making voyages to the Feegee group,—a large number
of them having settled there (as stated elsewhere),—while
but a limited number of Feegeeans find their way
to the Friendly Islands. There is another reason for
this unequally-balanced migration: and that is, that the
Tongans are much bolder and better sailors than their
western neighbors; for although the Feegees far excel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>way other South-Sea islanders in the art of <i>building</i>
their canoes (or ships as they might reasonably be
called), yet they are as far behind many others in the
art of <i>sailing</i> them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their superiority in ship-building may be attributed,
partly, to the excellent materials which these islands
abundantly afford; though this is not the sole cause.
However much we may deny to the Feegeeans the
possession of moral qualities, we are at the same time
forced to admit their great intellectual capacity,—as
exhibited in the advanced state of their arts and manufactures.
In intellectual capacity, however, the Friendly
Islanders are their equals; and the superiority of the
Feegeeans even in “canoe architecture” is no longer
acknowledged. It is true the Tongans go to the Feegee
group for most of their large double vessels; but that is
for the reasons already stated,—the greater abundance
and superior quality of the timber and other materials
produced there. In the Feegee “dockyards,” the Tongans
build for themselves; and have even improved
upon the borrowed pattern.</p>

<p class='c016'>This intercourse,—partaking somewhat of the character
of an alliance,—although in some respects advantageous
to the Friendly Islanders, may be regarded,
upon the whole, as unfortunate for them. If it has improved
their knowledge in arts and manufactures, it has
far more than counterbalanced this advantage by the
damage done to their moral character. It is always
much easier to make proselytes to vice than to virtue,—as
is proved in this instance: for his intercourse with
the ferocious Feegee has done much to deteriorate the
character of the Tongan. From that source he has imbibed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>a fondness for war and other wicked customs; and
in all probability, had this influence been permitted to
continue uninterrupted for a few years longer, the horrid
habit of cannibalism—though entirely repugnant to the
natural disposition of the Tongans—would have become
common among them. Indeed, there can be little doubt
that this would have been the ultimate consequence of
the alliance; for already its precursors—human sacrifices
and the vengeful immolation of enemies—had
made their appearance upon the Friendly Islands.
Happily for the Tongan, another influence—that of
the missionaries—came just in time to avert this dire
catastrophe; and, although this missionary interference
has not been the best of its kind, it is still preferable
to the paganism which it has partially succeeded in
subduing.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Tongan archipelago is much less extensive than
that of the Feegees,—the islands being of a limited
number, and only five or six of them of any considerable
size. Tongataboo, the largest, is about ninety
miles in circumference. From the most southern of the
group Eoo, to Vavau at the other extremity, it stretches,
northerly or northeasterly, about two hundred miles, in
a nearly direct line. The islands are all, with one or
two exceptions, low-lying, their surface being diversified
by a few hillocks or mounds, of fifty or sixty feet in
height, most of which have the appearance of being
artificial. Some of the smaller islets, as Kao, are
mountains of some six hundred feet elevation, rising
directly out of the sea; while Tofoa, near the eastern
edge of the archipelago, presents the appearance of an
elevated table-land. The larger number of them are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>clothed with a rich tropical vegetation, both natural
and cultivated, and their botany includes most of the
species common to the other islands of the South Sea.
We find the cocoa, and three other species of palm, the
pandanus, the bread-fruit in varieties, as also the useful
musacaæ,—the plantain, and banana. The ti-tree
(<i>Dracæna terminalis</i>), the paper-mulberry (<i>Broussonetia
papyrifera</i>), the sugar-cane, yams of many kinds, the
tree yielding the well-known <i>turmeric</i>, the beautiful
<i>casuarina</i>, and a hundred other sorts of plants, shrubs,
or trees, valuable for the product of their roots or fruits,
their sap and pith, of their trunks and branches, their
leaves and the fibrous material of their bark.</p>

<p class='c016'>As a scenic decoration to the soil, there is no part of
the world where more lovely landscapes are produced
by the aid of a luxuriant vegetation. They are perhaps
not equal in picturesque effect to those of the Feegee
group,—where mountains form an adjunct to the
scenery,—but in point of soft, quiet beauty, the landscapes
of the Tonga Islands are not surpassed by any
others in the tropical world; and with the climate they
enjoy—that of an endless summer—they might well
answer to the description of the “abode of the Blessed.”
And, indeed, when Tasman first looked upon these
islands, they perhaps merited the title more than any
other spot on the habitable globe; for, if any people
on this earth might be esteemed happy and blessed,
surely it was the inhabitants of these fair isles of the
far Southern Sea. Tasman even records the remarkable
fact, that he saw no arms among them,—no weapons
of war! and perhaps, at that time, neither the detestable
trade nor its implements were known to them. Alas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>in little more than a century afterwards, this peaceful
aspect was no longer presented. When the great English
navigator visited these islands, he found the war-club
and spear in the hands of the people, both of
Feegee pattern, and undoubtedly of the same ill-omened
origin.</p>

<p class='c016'>The personal appearance of the Friendly Islanders
differs not a great deal from that of the other South-Sea
tribes or nations. Of course we speak only of the true
Polynesians of the brown complexion, without reference
to the black-skinned islanders—as the Feegees and
others of the Papuan stock. The two have neither resemblance
nor relationship to one another; and it would
not be difficult to show that they are of a totally distinct
origin. As for the blacks, it is not even certain that
they are themselves of one original stock; for the splendidly-developed
cannibal of Feegee presents very few
features in common with the wretched kangaroo-eater
of West Australia. Whether the black islanders (or
Melanesians as they have been designated) originally
came from one source, is still a question for ethnologists;
but there can be no doubt as to the direction
whence they entered upon the colonization of the Pacific.
That was certainly upon its western border, beyond
which they have not made much progress: since
the Feegeean archipelago is at the present time their
most advanced station to the eastward. The brown or
Polynesian races, on the contrary, began their migrations
from the eastern border of the great ocean—in
other words, they came from America; and the so-called
Indians of America are, in my opinion, the <i>progenitors</i>,
not the <i>descendants</i>, of these people of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Ocean world. If learned ethnologists will give their
attention to this view of the subject, and disembarrass
their minds of that fabulous old fancy, about an original
stock situated somewhere (they know not exactly where)
upon the steppes of Asia, they will perhaps arrive at a
more rational hypothesis about the peopling of the so-called
new worlds, both the American and Oceanic.
They will be able to prove—what might be here done
if space would permit—that the Polynesians are emigrants
from tropical America, and that the Sandwich
Islanders came originally from California, and not the
Californians from the island homes of Hawaii.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is of slight importance here how this question may
be viewed. Enough to know that the natives of the
Tonga group bear a strong resemblance to those of the
other Polynesian archipelagos—to the Otaheitans and
New Zealanders, but most of all to the inhabitants of
the Samoan or Navigators’ Islands, of whom, indeed,
they may be regarded as a branch, with a separate
political and geographical existence. Their language
also confirms the affinity, as it is merely a dialect of
the common tongue spoken by all the Polynesians.</p>

<p class='c016'>Whatever difference exists between the Tongans and
other Polynesians in point of personal appearance, is in
favor of the former. The men are generally regarded
as the best-looking of all South-Sea Islanders, and the
women among the fairest of their sex. Many of them
would be accounted beautiful in any part of the world;
and as a general rule, they possess personal beauty in a
far higher degree than the much-talked-of Otaheitans.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Tongans are of tall stature—rather above than
under that of European nations. Men of six feet are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>common enough; though few are seen of what might be
termed gigantic proportions. In fact, the true medium
size is almost universal, and the excess in either direction
forms the exception. The bulk of their bodies is
in perfect proportion to their height. Unlike the black
Feegeeans—who are often bony and gaunt—the Tongans
possess well-rounded arms and limbs; and the
hands and feet, especially those of the women, are small
and elegantly shaped.</p>

<p class='c016'>To give a delineation of their features would be a
difficult task—since these are so varied in different
individuals, that it would be almost impossible to select
a good typical face. Indeed the same might be said of
nearly every nation on the face of the earth; and the
difficulty will be understood by your making an attempt
to describe some face that will answer for every set of
features in a large town, or even a small village; or
still, with greater limitation, for the different individuals
of a single family. Just such a variety there will be
found among the faces of the Friendly Islanders, as you
might note in the inhabitants of an English town or
county; and hence the difficulty of making a correct
likeness. A few characteristic points, however, may be
given, both as to their features and complexion. Their
lips are scarcely ever of a thick or negro form; and
although the noses are in general rounded at the end,
this rule is not universal;—many have genuine Roman
noses, and what may be termed a full set of the best
Italian features. There is also less difference between
the sexes in regard to their features than is usually
seen elsewhere—those of the women being only distinguished
by their less size.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The forms of the women constitute a more marked
distinction; and among the beauties of Tonga are many
that might be termed models in respect to shape and
proportions. In color, the Tongans are lighter than
most other South-Sea Islanders. Some of the better
classes of women—those least exposed to the open air—show
skins of a light olive tint; and the children of
all are nearly white after birth. They become browner
less from age than exposure to the sun; for, as soon as
they are able to be abroad, they scarce ever afterwards
enter under the shadow of a roof, except during the
hours of night.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Tongans have good eyes and teeth; but in this
respect they are not superior to many other Oceanic
tribes—even the black Feegeeans possessing both eyes
and “ivories” scarce surpassed anywhere. The Tongans,
however, have the advantage of their dusky neighbors
in the matter of hair—their heads being clothed
with a luxuriant growth of true hair. Sometimes it is
quite straight, as among the American Indians, but
oftener with a slight wave or undulation, or a curl approaching,
but never quite arriving at the condition of
“crisp.”</p>

<p class='c016'>His hair in its natural color is jet black; and it is to
be regretted that the Tongans have not the good taste to
leave it to its natural hue. On the contrary, their fashion
is to stain it of a reddish-brown, a purple or an
orange. The brown is obtained by the application of
burnt coral, the purple from a vegetable dye applied
poultice-fashion to the hair, and the orange is produced
by a copious lathering of common turmeric,—with which
the women also sometimes anoint their bodies, and those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of their children. This fashion of hair-dyeing is also
common to the Feegees, and whether they obtained it
from the Tongans, or the Tongans from them, is an unsettled
point. The more probable hypothesis would be,
that among many other ugly customs, it had its origin
in Feegee-land,—where, however, the people assign a
reason for practising it very different from the mere
motive of ornament. They allege that it also serves a
useful purpose, in preventing the too great fructification
of a breed of parasitic insects,—that would otherwise
find the immense mop of the frizzly Feegeean a
most convenient dwelling-place, and a secure asylum
from danger. This may have had something to do with
the origin of the custom; but once established for purposes
of utility, it is now confirmed, and kept up by the
Tongans as a useless ornament. Their taste in the color
runs exactly counter to that of European fashionables.
What a pity it is that the two could not make an exchange
of hair! Then both parties, like a pair of advertisements
in the “Times,” would exactly <i>fit</i> each other.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides the varied fashion in colors, there is also great
variety in the styles in which the Tongans wear their
hair. Some cut it short on one side of their head, leaving
it at full length on the other; some shave a small
patch, or cut off only a single lock; while others—and
these certainly display the best taste—leave it to grow
out in all its full luxuriance. In this, again, we find the
European fashion reversed, for the women are those who
wear it shortest. The men, although they are not without
beard, usually crop this appendage very close, or
shave it off altogether,—a piece of shell, or rather a
pair of shells, serving them for a razor.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>The mode is to place the thin edge of one shell underneath
the hair,—just as a hair-cutter does his comb,—and
with the edge of the other applied above, the
hairs are rasped through and divided. There are regular
barbers for this purpose, who by practice have been
rendered exceedingly dexterous in its performance; and
the victim of the operation alleges that there is little
or no pain produced,—at all events, it does not bring
the tears to his eyes, as a dull razor often does with us
poor thin-skinned Europeans!</p>

<p class='c016'>The dress of the Tongans is very similar to that of
the Otaheitans, so often described and well known; but
we cannot pass it here without remarking a notable
peculiarity on the part of the Polynesian people, as
exhibited in the character of their costume. The native
tribes of almost all other warm climates content themselves
with the most scant covering,—generally with
no covering at all, but rarely with anything that may be
termed a skirt. In South America most tribes wear the
“guayuco,”—a mere strip around the loins, and among
the Feegees the “malo” or “masi” of the men, and the
scant “liku” of the women are the only excuse for a
modest garment. In Africa we find tribes equally destitute
of clothing, and the same remark will apply to the
tropical countries all around the globe. Here, however,
amongst a people dwelling in the middle of a vast ocean,—isolated
from the whole civilized world, we find a natural
instinct of modesty that does credit to their character,
and is even in keeping with that character, as first observed
by voyagers to the South Seas. Whatever acts of
indelicacy may be alleged against the Otaheitans, this has
been much exaggerated by their intercourse with immoral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>white men; but none of such criminal conduct can be
charged against the natives of the Friendly Isles. On
the contrary, the behavior of these, both among themselves
and in presence of European visitors, has been
ever characterized by a modesty that would shame either
Regent Street or Ratcliffe Highway.</p>

<p class='c016'>A description of the national costume of the Tongans,
though often given, is not unworthy of a place here;
and we shall give it as briefly as a proper understanding
of it will allow. There is but one “garment” to be described,
and that is the “pareu,” which will be better
understood, perhaps, by calling it a “petticoat.” The
material is usually of “tapa” cloth,—a fabric of native
manufacture, to be described hereafter,—and the cutting
out is one of the simplest of performances, requiring
neither a tailor for the men, nor a dressmaker for the
other sex, for every one can make their own pareu. It
needs only to clip a piece of “tapa” cloth in the form
of an “oblong square”—an ample one, being about
two yards either way. This is wrapped round the
body,—the middle part against the small of the back,—and
then both ends brought round to the front are
lapped over each other as far as they will go, producing,
of course, a double fold of the cloth. A girdle is next
tied around the waist,—usually a cord of ornamental
plait; and this divides the piece of tapa into body and
skirt. The latter is of such a length as to stretch below
the calf of the leg,—sometimes down to the ankle,—and
the upper part or body <i>would</i> reach to the shoulders,
if the weather required it, and often does <i>when the missionaries
require it</i>. But not at any other time: such
an ungraceful mode of wearing the pareu was never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>intended by the simple Tongans, who never dreamt of
there being any immodesty in their fashion until told of
it by their puritanical preceptors!</p>

<p class='c016'>Tongan-fashion, the pareu is a sort of tunic, and a
most graceful garment to boot; Methodist fashion, it
becomes a gown or rather a sleeveless wrapper that resembles
a sack. But if the body part is not to be used
in this way, how, you will ask, is it to be disposed of?
Is it allowed to hang down outside, like the gown of a
slattern woman, who has only half got into it? No such
thing. The natural arrangement is both simple and
peculiar; and produces, moreover, a costume that is not
only characteristic but graceful to the eye that once becomes
used to it. The upper half of the tapa cloth is
neatly folded or turned, until it becomes a thick roll;
and this roll, brought round the body, just above the
girdle, is secured in that position. The swell thus produced
causes the waist to appear smaller by contrast;
and the effect of a well-formed bust, rising above the
roll of tapa cloth, is undoubtedly striking and elegant.
In cold weather, but more especially at night, the roll is
taken out, and the shoulders are then covered; for it is
to be observed that the pareu, worn by day as a dress, is
also kept on at night as a sleeping-gown, more especially
by those who possess only a limited wardrobe. It is not
always the cold that requires it to be kept on at night.
It is more used, at this time, as a protection against the
mosquitoes, that abound amidst the luxuriant vegetation
of the Tongan Islands.</p>

<p class='c016'>The “pareu” is not always made of the “tapa”
cloth. Fine mats, woven from the fibres of the screw-pine
(<i>pandanus</i>), are equally in vogue; and, upon festive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>occasions, a full-dress pareu is embellished with red
feather-work, adding greatly to the elegance and picturesqueness
of its appearance. A coarser and scantier
pareu is to be seen among the poorer people, the material
of which is a rough tapa, fabricated from the bark
of the bread-fruit, and not unfrequently this is only a
mere strip wrapped around the loins; in other words, a
“malo,” “maro,” or “maso,”—as it is indifferently
written in the varied orthography of the voyagers.
Having described this only and unique garment, we
have finished with the costume of the Tongan Islanders,
both men and women,—for both wear the pareu alike.
The head is almost universally uncovered; and no
head-dress is ever worn unless a cap of feathers by the
great chiefs, and this only upon rare and grand occasions.
It is a sort of chaplet encircling the head, and
deeper in front than behind. Over the forehead the
plumes stand up to a height of twelve or fifteen inches,
gradually lowering on each side as the ray extends
backward beyond the ears. The main row is made
with the beautiful tail-plumes of the tropic bird <i>Phaeton
æthereus</i>, while the front or fillet part of the cap is
ornamented with the scarlet feathers of a species of
parrot.</p>

<p class='c016'>The head-dress of the women consists simply of fresh
flowers: a profusion of which—among others the beautiful
blossoms of the orange—is always easily obtained.
An ear-pendant is also worn,—a piece of ivory of
about two inches in length, passed through two holes,
pierced in the lobe of the ear for this purpose. The
pendant hangs horizontally, the two holes balancing it,
and keeping it in position. A necklace also of pearl-shells,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>shaped into beads, is worn. Sometimes a string
of the seed of the pandanus is added, and an additional
ornament is an armlet of mother-o’-pearl, fashioned into
the form of a ring. Only the men tattoo themselves;
and the process is confined to that portion of the body
from the waist to the thighs, which is always covered
with the pareu. The practice of tattooing perhaps first
originated in the desire to equalize age with youth, and
to hide an ugly physiognomy. But the Tongan Islander
has no ugliness to conceal, and both men and women
have had the good taste to refrain from disfiguring the
fair features which nature has so bountifully bestowed
upon them. The only marks of tattoo to be seen upon
the women are a few fine lines upon the palms of their
hands; nor do they disfigure their fair skins with the
hideous pigments so much in use among other tribes,
of what we are in the habit of terming savages.</p>

<p class='c016'>They anoint the body with a fine oil procured from
the cocoanut, and which is also perfumed by various
kinds of flowers that are allowed to macerate in the
oil; but this toilet is somewhat expensive, and is only
practised by the better classes of the community. All,
however, both rich and poor, are addicted to habits of
extreme cleanliness, and bathing in fresh water is a
frequent performance. They object to bathing in the
sea; and when they do so, always finish the bath by
pouring fresh water over their bodies,—a practice
which they allege prevents the skin from becoming
rough, which the sea-water would otherwise make it.</p>

<p class='c016'>House architecture in the Tongan Islands is in rather
a backward state. They have produced no Wrens nor
Inigo Joneses; but this arises from a natural cause.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>They have no need for great architects,—scarce any
need for houses either,—and only the richer Tongans
erect any dwelling more pretentious than a mere shed.
A few posts of palm-trunks are set up, and upon these
are placed the cross-beams, rafters, and roof. Pandanus
leaves, or those of the sugar-cane, form the thatch; and
the sides are left open underneath. In the houses of
the chiefs and more wealthy people there are walls of
pandanus mats, fastened to the uprights; and some of
these houses are of considerable size and neatly built.
The interiors are kept scrupulously clean,—the floors
being covered with beautiful mats woven in colored
patterns, and presenting all the gay appearance of costly
carpeting. There are neither chairs nor tables. The
men sit tailor-fashion, and the women in a reclining
posture, with both limbs turned a little to one side and
backwards. A curious enclosure or partition is formed
by setting a stiff mat, of about two feet width, upon its
edge,—the roll at each end steadying it and keeping it
in an upright position.</p>

<p class='c016'>The utensils to be observed are dishes, bowls, and
cups,—usually of calabash or cocoa-shells,—and an
endless variety of baskets of the most ingenious plait
and construction. The “stool-pillow” is also used; but
differing from that of the Feegees in the horizontal
piece having a hollow to receive the head. Many
kinds of musical instruments may be seen,—the Pandean
pipes, the nose-flute, and various kinds of bamboo
drums, all of which have been minutely described by
travellers. I am sorry to add that war-clubs and spears
for a similar purpose are also to be observed conspicuous
among the more useful implements of peace. Bows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and arrows, too, are common; but these are only employed
for shooting birds and small rodents, especially
rats, that are very numerous and destructive to the
crops.</p>

<p class='c016'>For food, the Tongans have the pig,—the same
variety as is so generally distributed throughout the
Oceanic Islands. It is stated that the Feegeeans obtained
this animal from the Friendly Isles; but I am
of opinion that in this case the benefit came the other
way, as the <i>Sus Papua</i> is more likely to have entered
the South Sea from its leeward rather than its windward
side. In all likelihood the dog may have been
derived from the eastern edge; but the pigs and poultry
would seem to be of western origin,—western as regards
the position of the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c016'>The principal food of the Friendly Islanders, however,
is of a vegetable nature, and consists of yams,
bread-fruit, taro, plantains, sweet potatoes, and, in fact,
most of those roots and fruits common to the other
islands of the Pacific. Fish also forms an important
article of their food. They drink the “kava,” or juice
of the <i>Piper methisticum</i>—or rather of its roots chewed
to a pulp; but they rarely indulge to that excess observed
among the Feegees, and they are not over fond
of the drink, except as a means of producing a species
of intoxication which gives them a momentary pleasure.
Many of them, especially the women, make wry faces
while partaking of it; and no wonder they do, for it is
at best a disgusting beverage.</p>

<p class='c016'>The time of the Tongan Islanders is passed pleasantly
enough, when there is no wicked war upon hand. The
men employ themselves in cultivating the ground or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>fishing; and here the woman is no longer the mere
slave and drudge—as almost universally elsewhere
among savage or even semi-civilized nations. This is
a great fact, which tells a wondrous tale—which speaks
trumpet-tongued to the credit of the Tongan Islander.
Not only do the men share the labor with their more
delicate companions, but everything else—their food,
conversation, and every enjoyment of life. Both partake
alike—eat together, drink together, and join at
once in the festive ceremony. In their grand dances—or
balls as they might more properly be termed—the
women play an important part; and these exhibitions,
though in the open air, are got up with an elegance
and éclat that would not disgrace the most fashionable
ball-room in Christendom. Their dances, indeed,
are far more graceful than anything ever seen
either at “Almacks” or the “Jardin Mabille.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The principal employment of the men is in the cultivation
of their yam and plantain grounds, many of
which extend to the size of fields, with fences that
would almost appear to have been erected as ornaments.
These are of canes, closely set, raised to the
height of six feet—wide spaces being left between the
fences of different owners to serve as roads for the
whole community. In the midst of these fields stand
the sheds, or houses, surrounded by splendid forms of
tropic vegetation, and forming pictures of a softly beautiful
character.</p>

<p class='c016'>The men also occupy themselves in the construction
of their canoes,—to procure the large ones, making a
voyage as already stated, to the Feegee Islands, and
sometimes remaining absent for several years.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>These, however, are usually professional boat-builders,
and form but a very small proportion of the forty thousand
people who inhabit the different islands of the Tongan
archipelago.</p>

<p class='c016'>The men also occasionally occupy themselves in weaving
mats and wicker baskets, and carving fancy toys out
of wood and shells; but the chief part of the manufacturing
business is in the hands of the women—more
especially the making of the tapa cloth, already so often
mentioned. An account of the manufacture may be
here introduced, with the proviso, that it is carried on
not only by the women of the Feegee group, but by
those of nearly all the other Polynesian Islands. There
are slight differences in the mode of manufacture, as
well as in the quality of the fabric; but the account
here given, both of the making and dyeing, will answer
pretty nearly for all.</p>

<p class='c016'>The bark of the malo-tree, or “paper-mulberry,” is
taken off in strips, as long as possible, and then steeped
in water, to facilitate the separation of the epidermis,
which is effected by a large volute shell. In this state
it is kept for some time, although fit for immediate use.
A log, flattened on the upper side, is so fixed as to
spring a little, and on this the strips of bark—or <i>masi</i>,
as it is called—are beaten with an <i>iki</i>, or mallet, about
two inches square, and grooved longitudinally on three
of its sides. Two lengths of the wet <i>masi</i> are generally
beaten together, in order to secure greater strength—the
gluten which they contain being sufficient to keep
their fibres united. A two-inch strip can thus be beaten
out to the width of a foot and a half; but the length
is at the same time reduced. The pieces are neatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>lapped together with the starch of the taro, or arrowroot,
boiled whole; and thus reach a length of many yards.
The “widths” are also joined by the same means laterally,
so as to form pieces of fifteen or thirty feet square,
and upon these, the ladies exhaust their ornamenting
skill. The middle of the square is printed with a red-brown,
by the following process:—Upon a convex
board, several feet long, are arranged parallel, at about
a finger-width apart, thin straight slips of bamboo, a
quarter of an inch wide. By the side of these, curved
pieces, formed of the midrib of cocoanut leaflets, are
arranged. On the board thus prepared the cloth is laid,
and rubbed over with a dye obtained from the <i>lauci</i>
(<i>Aleurites triloba</i>). The cloth of course, takes the dye
upon those parts which receive pressure, being supported
by the slips beneath; and thus shows the same
pattern in the color employed. A stronger preparation
of the same dye, laid on with a sort of brush, is used to
divide the square into oblong compartments, with large
round or radiated dots in the centre. The <i>kesa</i>, or dye,
when good, dries bright. Blank borders, two or three
feet wide, are still left on two sides of the square; and
to elaborate the ornamentation of these, so as to excite
applause, is the pride of every lady. There is now an
entire change of apparatus. The operator works on a
plain board; the red dye gives place to a jet black; the
pattern is now formed of a strip of banana-leaf placed
on the upper surface of the cloth. Out of the leaf is
cut the pattern—not more than an inch long—which
the lady wishes to print upon the border, and holds by
her first and middle finger, pressing it down with the
thumb. Then taking a soft pad of cloth, steeped in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>dye, in her right hand, she rubs it firmly over the stencil,
and a fair, sharp figure is made. The practised fingers
of the operator move quickly, but it is, after all, a tedious
process.</p>

<p class='c016'>I regret to add, that the men employ themselves in an
art of less utility: the manufacture of war weapons—clubs
and spears—which the people of the different
islands, and even those of the same, too often brandish
against one another. This war spirit is entirely owing
to their intercourse with the ferocious Feegees, whose
boasting and ambitious spirit they are too prone to emulate.
In fact, their admiration of the Feegee habits is
something surprising; and can only be accounted for by
the fact, that while visiting these savages and professed
warriors, the Tongans have become imbued with a certain
fear of them. They acknowledge the more reckless
spirit of their allies, and are also aware that in
intellectual capacity the black men are not inferior to
themselves. They certainly are inferior in courage, as
in every good moral quality; but the Tongans can hardly
believe this, since their cruel and ferocious conduct
seems to give color to the contrary idea. In fact, it is
this that inspires them with a kind of respect, which has
no other foundation than a vague sense of fear. Hence
they endeavor to emulate the actions that produce this
fear, and this leads them to go to war with one another.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is to be regretted that the missionaries have supplied
them with a motive. Their late wars are solely
due to missionary influence,—for Methodism upon the
Tongan Islands has adopted one of the doctrines of
Mahomet, and believes in the faith being propagated by
the sword. A usurper, who wishes to be king over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>whole group, has embraced the Methodist form of Christianity,
and linked himself with its teachers,—who offer
to aid him with all their influence; and these formerly
peaceful islands now present the painful spectacle of a
divided nationality,—the “Christian party,” and the
“Devil’s party.” The object of conquest on the part
of the former is to place the Devil’s party under the
absolute sovereignty of a despot, whose laws will be
dictated by his missionary ministers. Of the mildness
of these laws we have already some specimens, which
of course extend only to the “Christianized.” One of
them, which refers to the mode of wearing the pareu,
has been already hinted at,—and another is a still more
off-hand piece of legislation: being an edict that no one
hereafter shall be permitted to smoke tobacco, under
pain of a most severe punishment.</p>

<p class='c016'>When it is considered that the Tongan Islander enjoys
the “weed” (and grows it too) more than almost any
other smoker in creation, the severity of the “taboo”
may be understood. But it is very certain, if his Methodist
majesty were once firmly seated on his throne, <i>bluer</i>
laws than this would speedily be proclaimed. The
American Commodore Wilkes found things in this warlike
attitude when he visited the Tongan Islands; but
perceiving that the right was clearly on the side of the
“Devil’s party,” declined to interfere; or rather, his
interference, which would have speedily brought peace,
was rejected by the Christian party, instigated by the
sanguinary spirit of their “Christian” teachers. Not
so, Captain Croker, of Her Britannic Majesty’s service,
who came shortly after. This unreflecting officer—loath
to believe that royalty could be in the wrong—at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>once took side with the king and Christians, and
dashed headlong into the affair. The melancholy result
is well known. It ended by Captain Croker leaving his
body upon the field, alongside those of many of his
brave tars; and a disgraceful retreat of the Christian
party beyond the reach of their enemies.</p>

<p class='c016'>This interference of a British war-vessel in the affairs
of the Tongan Islanders, offers a strong contrast to our
conduct when in presence of the Feegees. There we
have the fact recorded of British officers being eyewitnesses
of the most horrid scenes,—wholesale murder
and cannibalism,—with full power to stay the crime
and full authority to punish it,—that authority which
would have been freely given them by the accord and
acclamation of the whole civilized world,—and yet
they stood by, in the character of idle spectators, fearful
of breaking through the delicate icy line of <i>non-intervention</i>!</p>

<p class='c016'>A strange theory it seems, that murder is no longer
murder, when the murderer and his victim chance to be
of a different nationality from our own! It is a distinction
too delicate to bear the investigation of the philosophic
mind; and perhaps will yet yield to a truer appreciation
of the principles of justice. There was no such
squeamishness displayed when royalty required support
upon the Tongan Islands; nor ever is there when self-interest
demands it otherwise. Mercy and justice may
both fail to disarrange the hypocritical fallacy of non-intervention;
but the principle always breaks down at
the call of political convenience.</p>

<p class='c020'>Asia has been remarkable, from the earliest times,
for having a large population without any fixed place
of residence, but who lead a <i>nomade</i> or wandering life.
It is not the only quarter of the globe where this kind
of people are found: as there are many <i>nomade</i> nations
in Africa, especially in the northern division of it; and
if we take the Indian race into consideration, we find
that both the North and South-American continents
have their tribes of wandering people. It is in Asia,
nevertheless, that we find this unsettled mode of life
carried out to its greatest extent,—it is there that we
find those great pastoral tribes,—or “hordes,” as they
have been termed,—who at different historical periods
have not only increased to the numerical strength of
large nationalities, but have also been powerful enough
to overrun adjacent empires, pushing their conquests
even into Europe itself. Such were the invasions of the
Mongols under Zenghis Khan, the Tartars under Timour,
and the Turks, whose degenerate descendants
now so feebly hold the vast territory won by their
wandering ancestors.</p>

<p class='c016'>The pastoral life, indeed, has its charms, that render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>it attractive to the natural disposition of man, and wherever
the opportunity offers of following it, this life will
be preferred to any other. It affords to man an abundant
supply of all his most prominent wants, without
requiring from him any very severe exertion, either of
mind or body; and, considering the natural indolence of
Asiatic people, it is not to be wondered at that so many
of them betake themselves to this mode of existence.
Their country, moreover, is peculiarly favorable to the
development of a pastoral race. Perhaps not one third
of the surface of the Asiatic continent is adapted to
agriculture. At least one half of it is occupied by treeless,
waterless plains, many of which have all the characters
of a desert, where an agricultural people could
not exist, or, at all events, where their labor would
be rewarded by only the most scant and precarious
returns.</p>

<p class='c016'>Even a pastoral people in these regions would find
but a sorry subsistence, were they confined to one spot;
for the luxurious herbage which, for the most part, characterizes
the great savanna plains of America, is either
altogether wanting upon the <i>steppes</i> of Asia, or at best
very meagre and inconstant. A fixed abode is therefore
impossible, except in the most fertile tracts or <i>oases</i>:
elsewhere, the nomad life is a necessity arising from the
circumstances of the soil.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would be difficult to define exactly the limits of the
territory occupied by the wandering races in Asia; but
in a general way it may be said that the whole central
portion of the continent is thus peopled: indeed, much
more than the central portion,—for, if we except the
rich agricultural countries of Hindostan and China, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>a small portion of Persia, Arabia, and Turkey, the whole
of Asia is of this character. The countries known as
Balk and Bokara, Yarkand and Khiva, with several
others of equal note, are merely the central points of
oases,—large towns, supported rather by commerce
than by the produce of agriculture, and having nomad
tribes dwelling within sight of their walls. Even the
present boundaries of Asiatic Turkey, Arabia and Persia,
contain within them a large proportion of nomadic population;
and the same is true of Eastern Poland and
Russia in Europe. A portion of the Affghan and Belochee
country is also inhabited by nomad people.</p>

<p class='c016'>These wandering people are of many different types
and races of men; but there is a certain similarity in
the habits and customs of all: as might be expected
from the similar circumstances in which they are placed.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is always the more sterile steppes that are thus occupied;
and this is easily accounted for: where fertile
districts occur the nomad life is no longer necessary.
Even a wandering tribe, entering upon such a tract,
would no longer have a motive for leaving it, and would
soon become attached to the soil,—in other words, would
cease to be wanderers; and whether they turned their
attention to the pursuit of agriculture, or not, they would
be certain to give up their tent-life, and fix themselves
in a permanent abode. This has been the history of
many Asiatic tribes; but there are many others, again,
who from time immemorial, have shown a repugnance to
the idea of fixing themselves to the soil. They prefer
the free roving life which the desert enables them to
indulge in; and wandering from place to place as the
choice of pasture guides them, occupy themselves entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>in feeding their flocks and herds,—the sole means
of their subsistence. These never have been, and never
could be, induced to reside in towns or villages.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor is it that they have been driven into these desert
tracts to seek shelter from political oppression,—as is
the case with some of the native tribes of Africa and
America. On the contrary, these Asiatic nomads are
more often the aggressors than the objects of aggression.
It is rather a matter of choice and propensity with them:
as with those tribes of the Arabian race,—known as
“Bedouins.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The proportion of the Asiatic wandering population
to those who dwell in towns, or fixed habitations, varies
according to the nature of the country. In many extensive
tracts, the former greatly exceed the latter;
and the more sterile steppes are almost exclusively occupied
by them. In general, they acknowledge the sovereignty
of some of the great powers,—such as the
empires of China, Russia, and Turkey, the kingdom of
Persia, or that of several powerful khans, as those of
Khiva and Bokara; but this sovereignty is, for the most
part, little more than nominal, and their allegiance is
readily thrown off, whenever they desire it. It is rarely
so strong, as to enable any of the aforesaid powers to
draw a heavy tribute from them; and some of the more
warlike of the wandering tribes are much courted and
caressed,—especially when their war services are required.
In general they claim an herditary right to the
territories over which they roam, and pay but little heed
to the orders of either king, khan, or emperor.</p>

<p class='c016'>As already stated, these wandering people are of different
races; in fact, they are of nearly all the varieties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>indigenous to the Asiatic continent; and a whole catalogue
of names might be given, of which Mongols, Tartars,
Turcomans, Usbecks, Kirghees, and Calmucks, are
perhaps the most generally known. It has been also
stated that in many points they are alike; but there are
also many important particulars in which they differ,—physical,
moral, and intellectual. Some of the “hordes,”
or tribes, are purely pastoral in their mode of life, and
of mild and hospitable dispositions, exceedingly fond of
strangers, and kind to such as come among them. Others
again are averse to all intercourse with others, than those
of their own race and religion, and are shy, if not inhospitable,
when visited by strangers. But there is a
class of a still less creditable character,—a large number
of tribes that are not only inhospitable, and hostile
to strangers, but as ferocious and bloodthirsty as any
savages in Africa, America, or the South-Sea Islands.</p>

<p class='c016'>As a fair specimen of this class we select the Turcomans;
in fact, they may be regarded as its <i>type</i>; and
our description henceforward may be regarded as applying
particularly to these people.</p>

<p class='c016'>The country of the Turcomans will be found upon the
map without difficulty; but to define its exact boundary
would be an impossibility, since none such exists. Were
you to travel along the whole northern frontier of Persia,
almost from the gates of Teheran to the eastern frontier
of the kingdom,—or even farther towards Balk,—you
would be pretty sure of hearing of Turcoman robbers,
and in very great danger of being plundered by them,—which
last misfortune would be of less importance, as it
would only be the prelude to your being either murdered
on the spot, or carried off by them into captivity. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>making this journey along the northern frontier of Persia,
you would become acquainted with the whereabouts
of the Turcoman hordes; or rather you would discover
that the whole north part of Persia,—a good broad
band of it extending hundreds of miles into its interior,—if
not absolutely in possession of the Turcomans, is
overrun and plundered by them at will. This, however,
is not their home,—it is only their “stamping-ground,”—the
home of their victims. Their place of habitual
residence lies further to the north, and is defined with
tolerable accuracy by its having the whole eastern shore
of the Caspian Sea for its western border, while the
Amou River (the ancient Oxus) may be generally regarded
as the limit of their range towards the east.
Some tribes go still further east than the Amou; but
those more particularly distinguished for their plundering
habits dwell within the limits described,—north of
the Elburz Mountains, and on the great steppe of Kaurezm,
where they are contiguous to the Usbeck community
of Khiva.</p>

<p class='c016'>The whole of this immense territory, stretching from
the eastern shore of the Caspian to the Amou and Aral
Sea, may be characterized as a true desert. Here and
there oases exist, but none of any importance, save the
country of Khiva itself: and even that is but a mere
irrigated strip, lying on both banks of the Oxus. Indeed,
it is difficult to believe that this territory of Khiva,
so insignificant in superficial extent, could have been the
seat of a powerful empire, as it once was.</p>

<p class='c016'>The desert, then, between the Caspian Sea and the
Oxus River may be regarded as the true land of the
Turcomans, and is usually known as Turcomania. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>is to remembered, however, that there are some
kindred tribes not included within the boundaries of
Turcomania—for the Turkistan of the geographers is
a country of much larger extent; besides, an important
division of the Turcoman races are settlers, or rather
wanderers in Armenia. To Turcomania proper, then,
and its inhabitants, we shall confine our remarks.</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall not stay to inquire into the origin of the
people now called Turcomans. Were we to speculate
upon that point, we should make but little progress in an
account of their habits and mode of living. They are
usually regarded as of Tartar origin, or of Usbeck
origin, or of Mongolian race; and in giving this account
of them, I am certain that I add very little to
your knowledge of what they really are. The truth is,
that the words Tartar and Mongol and some half-dozen
other titles, used in relation to the Asiatic races, are
without any very definite signification,—simply because
the relative distinctions of the different nations of that
continent are very imperfectly known; and learned ethnologists
are ever loath to a confession of limited knowledge.
One of this class, Mr. Latham,—who requires
only a few words of their language to decide categorically
to what variety of the human race a people belongs,—has
unfortunately added to this confusion by
pronouncing nearly everybody <i>Mongolian</i>: placing the
proud turbaned Turk in juxtaposition with the squat
and stunted Laplander! Of course this is only bringing
us back to the old idea, that all men are sprung
from a single pair of first parents,—a doctrine, which,
though popular, is difficult to reconcile with the rational
knowledge derived from ethnological investigation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>It matters little to our present purpose from what
original race the Turcoman has descended: whether
he be a true Turk, as some regard him, or whether he
is a descendant of the followers of the Great Khan of
the Tartars. He possesses the Tartar physiognomy to
a considerable extent—some of the tribes more than
others being thus distinguished,—and high cheek-bones,
flat noses, small oblique eyes, and scanty beards, are all
characteristics that are very generally observed. Some
of these peculiarities are more common among the
women than the men—many of the latter being tall,
stout, and well-made, while a large number may be
seen who have the regular features of a Persian. Perhaps
it would be safest to consider the present Turcoman
tribes as not belonging to a pure stock, but rather
an admixture of several; and their habit of taking
slaves from other nations, which has for a long time
existed among them, would give probability to this idea.
At all events, without some such hypothesis, it is difficult
to account for the wonderful variety, both in feature
and form, that is found among them. Their complexion
is swarthy, in some cases almost brown as that of an
American Indian; but constant exposure to the open
air, in all sorts of weather, has much to do in darkening
the hue of their skin. The newborn children are
nearly as white as those of the Persians; and their
young girls exhibit a ruddy brunette tint, which some
consider even more pleasing than a perfectly white complexion.</p>

<p class='c016'>The costume of the Turcoman, like that of most Oriental
nations, is rich and picturesque. The dress of the
men varies according to rank. Some of the very poorer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>people wear nothing but a short woollen tunic or shirt,
with a pair of coarse woollen drawers. Others, in place
of this shirt, are clad in a longer garment, a sort of
robe or wrapper, like a gentleman’s dressing-gown, made
of camel’s-hair cloth, or some coarse brown woollen
stuff. But the true Turcoman costume, and that worn
by all who can afford it, consists of a garment of mixed
silk and cotton,—the <i>baronnee</i>,—which descends below
the knee, and though open in front, is made to button
over the breast quite up to the neck. A gay sash around
the waist adds to the effect; and below the skirt are
seen trowsers of cotton or even silk. Cloth wrappers
around the legs serve in the place of boots or gaiters;
and on the feet are worn slippers of Persian fashion,
with socks of soft Koordish leather.</p>

<p class='c016'>As the material of which the baronnee is made is of
good quality—a mixture of silk and cotton—and as
the fabric is always striped or checkered in colors of
red, blue, purple, and green, the effect produced is that
of a certain picturesqueness. The head-dress adds to
this appearance—being a high fur cap, with truncated
top, the fur being that beautiful kind obtained from the
skins of the Astracan lamb, well known in commerce.
These caps are of different colors, either black, red, or
gray. Another style of head-dress much worn is a
round-topped or helmet-shaped cap, made of quilted
cotton-stuff; but this kind, although in use among the
Turcomans, is a more characteristic costume of their
enemies, the “Koords,” who wear it universally.</p>

<p class='c016'>The “jubba” is a kind of robe generally intended to
go over the other garments, and is usually of woollen
or camel’s-hair cloth. It is also made like a dressing-gown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>with wide sleeves,—tight, however, around the
wrist. It is of ample dimensions, and one side is lapped
over the other across the front, like a double-breasted
coat. The “jubba” is essentially a national garment.</p>

<p class='c016'>The dress of the women is exceedingly picturesque.
It is thus minutely described by a traveller:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“The head-dress of these women is singular enough:
most of them wear a lofty cap, with a broad crown,
resembling that of a soldier’s cap called a shako. This
is stuck upon the back of the head; and over it is
thrown a silk handkerchief of very brilliant colors,
which covers the top, and falls down on each side like
a veil. The front of this is covered with ornaments of
silver and gold, in various shapes; more frequently gold
coins, mohrs, or tomauns, strung in rows, with silver
bells or buttons, and chains depending from them;
hearts and other fanciful forms, with stones set in them.
The whole gives rather the idea of gorgeous trappings
for a horse, than ornaments for a female.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The frames of these monstrous caps are made of
light chips of wood, or split reeds, covered with cloth;
and when they do not wear these, they wrap a cloth
around their heads in the same form; and carelessly
throw another, like a veil over it. The veil or curtain
above spoken of covers the mouth; descending to the
breast. Earrings are worn in the ears; and their long
hair is divided, and plaited into four parts, disposed two
on each side; one of which falls down behind the
shoulders and one before, and both are strung with a
profusion of gold ornaments, agates, cornelians, and
other stones, according to the means and quality of the
wearer. The rest of their dress consists of a long, loose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>vest or shirt, with sleeves, which covers the whole person
down to the feet, and is open at the breast, in front,
but buttons or ties close up to the neck: this is made of
silk or cotton-stuff, red, blue, green, striped red, and
yellow, checked, or various-colored: underneath this,
are the zere-jameh, or drawers, also of silk or cotton;
and some wear a short <i>peerahn</i> or shirt of the same.
This, I believe, is all; but in the cold weather they
wear, in addition, jubbas, or coats like those of the men,
of striped stuff made of silk and cotton; on their feet
they generally wear slippers like those of the Persian
women.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The tents, or “portable houses” of the Turcomans—as
their movable dwellings rather deserve to be called—differ
from most structures of the kind in use elsewhere.
They are thus described by the same intelligent
traveller:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“The portable wooden houses of the Turcomans have
been referred to by several writers; but I am not aware
that any exact description of their structure has been
given. The frame is curiously constructed of light
wood, disposed in laths of about an inch broad by three
quarters thick, crossing one another diagonally, but at
right angles, about a foot asunder, and pinned at each
crossing with thongs of raw hide, so as to be movable;
and the whole framework may be closed up or opened
in the manner of those toys for children that represent a
company of soldiers, and close or expand at will, so as
to form open or close column.</p>

<p class='c016'>“One or more pieces thus constructed being stretched
out, surround a circular space of from fifteen to twenty
feet diameter; and form the skeleton of the walls,—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>are made firm by bands of hair or woollen ropes,
hitched round the end of each rod, to secure it in its position.
From the upper ends of these, rods of a similar kind,
bent near the wall end into somewhat less than a right
angle, are so disposed that the longer portions slope to
the centre, and being tied with ropes, form the framework
of a roof. Over this is thrown a covering of black
<i>numud</i>, leaving in the centre a large hole to give vent
to the smoke, and light to the dwelling. Similar numuds
are wrapped round the walls; and outside of these, to
keep all tight, is bound another frame, formed of split
reeds or cane, or of very light and tough wood, tied
together with strong twine, the pieces being perpendicular.
This is itself secured by a strong, broad band of
woven hair-stuff, which firmly unites. The large round
opening at top is covered, as occasion requires, by a
piece of numud, which is drawn off or on by a strong
cord, like a curtain. If the wind be powerful, a stick is
placed to leeward, which supports the fabric.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In most of these houses they do not keep a carpet
or numud constantly spread; but the better classes use
a carpet shaped somewhat in the form of a horseshoe,
having the centre cut out for the fireplace, and the ends
truncated, that those of inferior condition, or who do not
choose to take off their boots, may sit down upon the
ground. Upon this carpet they place one or two other
numuds, as may be required, for guests of distinction.
When they have women in the tent, a division of split
reeds is made for their convenience; but the richer
people have a separate tent for their private apartments.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The furniture consists of little more than that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>camels and horses; <i>joals</i>, or bags in which their goods
are packed, and which are often made of a very handsome
species of worsted velvet carpet, of rich patterns;
the swords, guns, spears, bows and arrows, and other
implements of the family, with odds and ends of every
description, may be seen hung on the ends of the wooden
rods, which form very convenient pins for the purpose.
Among some tribes all the domestic utensils are made
of wood,—calleeoons, trays for presenting food, milk-vessels,
&amp;c.: among others, all these things are formed
of clay or metal. Upon the black tops of the tents may
frequently be seen large white masses of sour curd,
expressed from buttermilk, and set to dry as future
store; this, broken down and mixed with water, forms
a very pleasant acidulous drink, and is used as the
basis of that intoxicating beverage called <i>kimmiz</i>. The
most common and most refreshing drink which they offer
to the weary and over-heated traveller in the forenoon is
buttermilk, or sour curds and water; and, indeed, a
modification of this, with some other simple sherbets,
are the only liquors presented at their meals.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Such are the wooden houses of the Turcomans, one
of which just makes a camel’s load. There are poorer
ones, of a less artificial construction, the framework of
which is formed of reeds.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The encampment is generally square, enclosing an
open space, or forming a broad street, the houses being
ranged on either side, with their doors towards each
other. At these may always be seen the most picturesque
groups, occupied with their various domestic
duties, or smoking their simple wooden <i>calleeoons</i>. The
more important encampments are often surrounded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>a fence of reeds, which serve to protect the flocks from
petty thefts.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It is now our place to inquire how the Turcomans
occupy their time. We have already described them as
a pastoral and nomadic people; and, under ordinary
circumstances, their employment consists in looking after
their flocks. In a few of the more fertile oases they
have habitations, or rather camps, of a more permanent
character, where they cultivate a little corn or barley, to
supply them with the material for bread; but these settlements,
if they deserve the name, are only exceptional;
and are used chiefly as a kind of head-quarters, where
the women and property are kept, while the men themselves
are absent on their thieving expeditions. More
generally their herds are kept on the move, and are
driven from place to place at short intervals of a few
weeks or even days. The striking and pitching of their
tents gives them employment; to which is added that of
milking the cattle, and making the cheese and butter.
The women, moreover, fill up their idle hours in weaving
the coarse blankets, or “numuds,” in plaiting mats,
and manufacturing various articles of dress or household
use. The more costly parts of their costume, however,
are not of native manufacture: these are obtained by
trade. The men alone look after the camels and horses,
taking special care of the latter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their flocks present a considerable variety of species.
Besides horses, cattle, and sheep, they own many camels,
and they have no less than three distinct varieties of this
valuable animal in their possession,—the dromedary with
two humps, and the common camel. The third sort is a
cross breed—or “mule”—between these two. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>dromedary is slightly made, and swifter than either of
the others, but it is not so powerful as either, and being
inferior as a beast of burden, is least cared for by the
Turcomans. The one-humped camel is in more general
use, and a good one will carry a load of six or seven
hundred pounds with ease. The mule camel is more
powerful than either of its parents, and also more docile
and capable of greater endurance. It grows to a very
large size, but is low in proportion to its bulk, with stout,
bony legs, and a large quantity of coarse, shaggy hair on
its haunch, shoulders, neck, and even on the crown of
its head, which gives it a strange, somewhat fantastic
appearance. Its color varies from light gray to brown,
though it is as often nearly black. This kind of camel
will carry a load of from eight hundred to a thousand
pounds.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Turcoman sheep are of the large-tailed breed,—their
tails often attaining enormous dimensions. This
variety of sheep is a true denizen of the desert, the fat
tail being unquestionably a provision of nature against
seasons of hunger,—just as in the single protuberance,
or “hump,” upon the camel.</p>

<p class='c016'>The horse of the Turcoman is the animal upon which
he sets most value. The breed possessed by him is celebrated
over all Eastern Asia, as that of the Arab is in
the West. They cannot be regarded, however, as handsome
horses, according to the true standard of “horse
beauty;” but the Turcoman cares less for this than for
other good qualities. In point of speed and endurance
they are not excelled, if equalled, by the horses of any
other country.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their size is that of the common English horse, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>they are very different in make. Their bodies are long
in proportion to the bulk of carcass; and they do not
appear to possess sufficient compactness of frame. Their
legs are also long, generally falling off in muscular development
below the knee-joint; and they would appear
to an English jockey too narrow in the counter. They
have also long necks, with large heavy heads. These
are the points which are generally observed in the Turcoman
horses; but it is to be remarked, that it is only
when in an under-condition they look so ungraceful; and
in this condition their owners are accustomed to keep
them, especially when they have any very heavy service
to perform. Feeding produces a better shape, and brings
them much nearer to the look of a well-bred English
horse.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their powers of endurance are indeed, almost incredible:
when trained for a chappow, or plundering expedition,
they will carry their rider and provisions for seven
or eight days together, at the rate of twenty or even
thirty fursungs—that is, from eighty to one hundred
miles—a day. Their mode of training is more like
that of our pugilistic and pedestrian performers, than
that adopted for race-horses. When any expedition of
great length, and requiring the exertion of much speed, is
in contemplation, they commence by running their horses
every day for many miles together; they feed them sparingly
on barley alone, and pile numuds upon them at
night to sweat them, until every particle of fat has been
removed, and the flesh becomes hard and tendonous.
Of this they judge by the feel of the muscles, particularly
on the crest, at the back of the neck, and on the
haunches; and when these are sufficiently firm and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>hard, they say in praise of the animal, that “his flesh
is marble.” After this sort of training, the horse will
proceed with expedition and perseverance, for almost
any length of time, without either falling off in condition
or knocking up, while horses that set out fat seldom survive.
They are taught a quick walk, a light trot, or a
sort of amble, which carries the rider on easily, at the
rate of six miles an hour; but they will also go at a
round canter, or gallop, for forty or fifty miles, without
ever drawing bridle or showing the least symptom of
fatigue. Their <i>yaboos</i>, or galloways, and large ponies
are fully as remarkable, if not superior, to their horses,
in their power of sustaining fatigue; they are stout,
compact, spirited beasts, without the fine blood of the
larger breeds, but more within the reach of the poorer
classes, and consequently used in by far greater numbers
than the superior and more expensive horses.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It is a common practice of the Turcomans, to teach
their horses to fight with their heels, and thus assist
their masters in the time of action. At the will of their
riders they will run at and lay hold with their teeth
of whatever man or animal may be before them. This
acquirement is useful in the day of battle and plunder,
for catching prisoners and stray cattle, but it at the
same time renders them vicious and dangerous to be
handled.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In addition to the flocks and herds, the Turcomans
possess a breed of very large fierce dogs, to assist them
in keeping their cattle. These are also necessary as
watch-dogs, to protect the camp from thieves as well as
more dangerous enemies to their peace; and so well
trained are those faithful creatures, that it would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>impossible for either friend or enemy to approach a Turcoman
camp without the inmates being forewarned in
time. Two or three of these dogs may always be seen
lying by the entrance of each tent; and throughout the
night several others keep sentry at the approaches to the
camp.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other breeds of dogs owned by them are used for
hunting,—for these wild wanderers sometimes devote
their hours to the chase. They have two sorts,—a
smooth-skinned dog, half hound half pointer, that hunts
chiefly by the scent; and a greyhound, of great swiftness,
with a coat of long, silky hair, which they make
use of in coursing,—hares and antelopes being their
game.</p>

<p class='c016'>They have a mode of hunting—also practised by
the Persians—which is peculiar. It should rather be
termed hawking than hunting, as a hawk is employed
for the purpose. It is a species of falcon denominated
“goork,” and is trained not only to dash at small game,
such as partridges and bustards, but upon antelopes and
even the wild ass that is found in plenty upon the plains
of Turcomania. You will wonder how a bird, not
larger than the common falcon, could capture such game
as this; but it will appear simple enough when the
method has been explained. The “goork” is trained to
fly at the quadruped, and fix its claws in one particular
place,—that is, upon the frontlet, just between the eyes.
When thus attached, the bird, instead of closing its wings
and remaining at rest, keeps them constantly in motion,
flapping them over the eyes of the quadruped. This it
does, no doubt, to enable it to retain its perch; while the
unfortunate animal, thus assailed, knows not in what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>direction to run, and is soon overtaken by the pursuing
sportsmen, and either speared or shot with the bow and
arrow.</p>

<p class='c016'>Wild boars are frequently hunted by the Turcomans
and this, like everything else with these rude centaurs,
is performed on horseback. The bow and arrow is but
a poor weapon when employed against the thick, tough
hide of the Hyrcanian boar (for he is literally the Hyrcanian
boar), and of course the matchlock would be
equally ineffective. How, then, does the Turcoman
sportsman manage to bag this bristly game? With all
the ease in the world. It costs him only the effort of
galloping his horse close up to the side of the boar after
he has been brought to by the dogs, and then suddenly
wheeling the steed. The latter, well trained to the task,
without further prompting, goes through the rest of the
performance, which consists in administering to the boar
such a slap with his iron-shod heel, as to prostrate the
porcine quadruped, often killing it on the instant!</p>

<p class='c016'>Such employments and such diversions occupy only
a small portion of the Turcoman’s time. He follows
another calling of a far less creditable character, which
unfortunately he regards as the most honorable occupation
of his life. This is the calling of the robber. His
pastoral pursuits are matters of only secondary consideration.
He only looks to them as a means of supplying
his daily wants,—his food and the more necessary
portion of his clothing; but he has other wants that
may be deemed luxuries. He requires to keep up his
stock of horses and camels, and wishes to increase them.
He needs costly gear for his horse, and costly garments
for himself,—and he is desirous of being possessed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>fine weapons, such as spears, swords, bows, matchlocks,
daggers, and pistols. His most effective weapons are
the spear and sword, and these are the kinds he chiefly
uses.</p>

<p class='c016'>His spear consists of a steel head with four flutes,
and edges very sharp, fixed upon a slender shaft of from
eight to ten feet in length. In using it he couches it
under the left arm, and directs it with the right hand,
either straightforward, or to the right or left; if to the
right, the butt of the shaft lies across the hinder part
of the saddle; if to the left, the forepart of the spear
rests on the horse’s neck. The Turcomans manage
their horses with the left hand, but most of these are so
well broken as to obey the movement of the knee, or
the impulse of the body. When close to their object,
they frequently grasp the spear with both hands, to give
greater effect to the thrust. The horse, spurred to the
full speed of a charge, in this way, offers an attack no
doubt very formidable in appearance, but perhaps less
really dangerous than the other, in which success depends
so greatly on skill and address. The Turcomans
are all sufficiently dexterous with the sword, which is
almost universally formed in the curved Persian fashion,
and very sharp; they also wear a dagger at the waist-belt.
Firearms are as yet little in use among them;
they possess a few, taken from the travellers they have
plundered, and procure a few more occasionally from the
Russians by the way of Bokara. Some use bows and
arrows, but they are by no means so dexterous as their
ancestors were in the handling of those weapons.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mounted, then, upon his matchless steed, and armed
with spear and sword, the Turcoman goes forth to practise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>his favorite profession,—that of plunder. He does
not go alone, nor with a small number of his comrades,
either. The number depends altogether on the distance
or danger of the expedition; and where these are considered
great, a troop of five hundred, or even a thousand,
usually proceed together upon their errand.</p>

<p class='c016'>You will be inquiring to what point they direct themselves,—east,
west, north, or south? That altogether
depends upon who may be their enemies for the time, for
along with their desire for booty, there is also mixed up
something like a sentiment of hostility. In this respect,
however, the Turcoman is a true Ishmaelite, and in lack
of other victim he will not hesitate to plunder the people
of a kindred race. Indeed, several of the Turcoman
tribes have long been at war with one another; and
their animosity is quite as deadly among themselves as
when directed against strangers to their race. The <i>butt</i>,
however, of most of the Turcoman expeditions is the
northern part of Persia,—Korassan in particular. It
is into this province that most of their great forays are
directed, either against the peaceful citizens of the Persian
towns and villages, or as often against the merchant
caravans that are constantly passing between Teheran
and the cities of the east,—Mushed, Balkh, Bokara,
Herat, and Kelat. I have already stated that these
forays are pushed far into the interior of Persia; and
the fact of Persia permitting such a state of things to
continue will perhaps surprise you; but you would not
be surprised were you better acquainted with the condition
of that kingdom. From historic associations, you
believe Persia to be a powerful nation; and so it once
was, both powerful and prosperous. That day is past,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>and at the present hour, this decaying monarchy is not
only powerless to maintain order within its own borders,
but is even threatened with annihilation from those very
nomad races that have so often given laws to the great
empires of Asia. Even at this moment, the more powerful
Tartar Khans turn a longing look towards the
tottering throne of Nadir Shah; and he of Khiva has
more than once made a feint at invasion. But the subject
is too extensive to be discussed here. It is only
introduced to explain with what facility a few hundreds
of Turcoman robbers can enter and harass the land.
We find a parallel in many other parts of the world,—old
as well as new. In the latter, the northern provinces
of Mexico, and the southern countries of La Plata and
Paraguay, are in just such a condition: the weak, worn-out
descendants of the Spanish conquerors on one side,
well representing the remnants of the race of Nadir
Shah; while, on the other, the Turcoman is type enough
of the Red Indian. The comparison, however, is not
just to the latter. He, at least, is possessed of courage
and prowess; while the Turcoman, notwithstanding his
propensities for plunder, and the bloodthirsty ferocity
of his character, is as arrant a coward as ever carried
lance. Even the Persian can cope with him, when
fairly matched; and the merchant-caravans,—which
are usually made up of true Turks, and other races
possessing a little “pluck,” are never attacked, unless
when outnumbered in the ratio of three to one.</p>

<p class='c016'>For all this, the whole northern portion of the Persian
kingdom is left to the mercy of these desert-robbers.
The towns and villages have each their large fortress,
into which the people retire whenever the plunderers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>make their appearance, and there dwell till the latter
have ridden away,—driving off their flocks and herds
to the desert fastnesses. Even the poor farmer is
obliged to build a fortress in the middle of his fields,
to which he may retire upon the occasion of any sudden
alarm, and his laborers till the ground with their
swords by their sides, and their matchlocks lying near!</p>

<p class='c016'>These field fortresses of Korassan are altogether so
curious, both as to construction and purpose, that we
cannot pass them without a word of description. They
are usually placed in some conspicuous place, at a convenient
distance from all parts of the cultivated tract.
They are built of mud, and raised to a height of fifteen
or twenty feet, of a circular form,—bearing some resemblance
to the well-known round towers of Ireland.
A small aperture is left open at the bottom, through
which those seeking shelter may just squeeze their
bodies, and this being barricaded inside, the defence
is complete. From the top—which can be reached
easily on the inside—the farmer and his laborers can
use their matchlocks with effect; but they are never
called upon to do so,—as the cowardly freebooter takes
good care to give the mud tower a wide birth. He has
no weapons by which he might assail it; and, moreover,
he has no time for sieges: since an hour’s delay might
bring him into danger from the force that is fast approaching.
His only thought is to keep on his course,
and sweep off such cattle, or make prisoners of such
people as he may chance to find unwarned and unarmed.
Now and then he ventures upon an attack—where
there is much booty to tempt him, and but a
weak force to defend it. His enemies,—the hated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“Kuzzilbashes,” as he calls the Persians,—if defeated,
have no mercy to expect from him. All who resist are
killed upon the spot, and often torture is the mode of
their death; but if they can be made prisoners, the
desert-robber prefers letting them live, as a captive is
to him a more valuable consideration than the death
of an enemy. His prisoner, once secured, knows tolerably
well what is to follow. The first thing the Turcoman
does is to bind the victim’s hands securely behind
his back; he then puts a long halter around his neck,
attaching the other end of it to the tail of his horse, and
in this fashion the homeward march commences. If the
poor pedestrian does not keep pace with the horse, he
knows what he may expect,—to be dragged at intervals
along the ground, and perhaps torn to pieces upon the
rocks. With this horrid fate before his fancy, he makes
efforts almost superhuman to keep pace with the troop
of his inhuman captors: though well aware that they
are leading him off into a hopeless bondage.</p>

<p class='c016'>At night, his feet are also tied; and, thrown down
upon the earth, he is covered with a coarse “numud.”
Do not fancy that this is done to screen him from the
cold: the object is very different indeed. The numud
is placed over him in order that two of his captors may
sleep upon its edges—one on each side of him—thus
holding him down, and frustrating any chance of escape.</p>

<p class='c016'>On arriving at the robber-camp, the captive is not
kept long in suspense as to his future fate. His owner—for
he is now in reality a slave—wants a new sword,
or a piece of silken cloth, or a camel, or some other
article of luxury. That he can obtain either at Khiva
or Bokara, in exchange for his slave; and therefore the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>new captive—or captives, as the chance may be—is
marched off to the ready market. This is no isolated
nor rare incident. It is one of every-day occurrence;
and it is a noted fact, that of the three hundred thousand
people who constitute the subjects of the Khivan
Khan, nearly one half are Persian slaves obtained from
the robbers of Turcomania!</p>

<p class='c016'>The political organization of the Turcomans is of the
patriarchal character. From necessity they dwell in
small communities that are termed “teers,” the literal
signification of which is “arrows,”—though for what
reason they are so styled does not appear. Perhaps it
is on account of the rapidity of their movements: for,
in hostile excursions, or moving from place to place,
they proceed with a celerity that may be compared to
arrows.</p>

<p class='c016'>Over each tribe or teer there is a chief, similar to the
“sheik” of the Arab tribes,—and indeed, many of their
customs offer a close analogy to those of the wandering
Bedouins of Arabia and Egypt, and the Kabyles of
Morocco and the Algerine provinces. The circumstances
of life—almost alike to both—could not fail to produce
many striking resemblances.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Turcoman tribes, as already observed, frequently
go to war with each other, but they oftener unite to rob the
common enemy,—the caravan or the Persian village.
In these mere plundering expeditions they go in such
numbers as the case may require; but when called forth
to take side in anything like a national war, they can
muster to the strength of many thousands; and then
indeed, they become terrible,—even to the most potent
sovereigns of Central Asia, by whom much diplomacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>is employed to enlist them on one side or the other. It
matters little to them what the cause be,—he who can
promise them the largest booty in cattle or slaves is sure
to have the help of their spears and swords.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Turcomans are not Pagans,—that is, they are
not professedly so,—though, for all the regard which
they pay to religious observances, they might as well be
termed true Infidels. They profess a religion, however,
and that is Mohametanism in its worst and most bigoted
form,—the “Sunnite.” The Persians, as is well known,
hold the milder Sheean doctrines; and as the votaries
of the two, in most countries where both are practised,
cordially hate each other, so it is between Turcomans
and Persians. The former even scorn the Persian creed,
calling its followers “Infidel” dogs, or <i>Kuzzilbashes</i>; and
this bigoted rancor gives them a sort of plausible excuse
for the hostile attitude which they hold towards them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Taking them upon the whole, the Turcomans may be
looked upon as true savages,—savages dressed in <i>silk</i>
instead of in <i>skins</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE OTTOMACS, OR DIRT-EATERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>On the banks of the Orinoco, a short distance above
the point where that mighty river makes its second great
sweep to the eastward, dwells a remarkable people,—a
tribe of savages that, even among savages, are remarkable
for many peculiar and singular customs. These are
the <i>Ottomacs</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>They have been long known,—and by the narratives
of the early Spanish missionaries, rendered notorious,—on
account of some curious habits; but although the
missionaries have resided among them, and endeavored
to bring them within “sound of the bell,” their efforts
have met with a very partial and temporary success;
and at this present hour, the Ottomacs are as savage in
their habits, and as singular in their customs, as they
were in the days of Columbus.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Ottomacs are neither a stunted nor yet a weak
race of men. Their bodies are strong, and their arms
and limbs stout and muscular; but they are remarkably
ill-featured, with an expression of countenance habitually
stern and vindictive.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their costume is easily described, or rather cannot be
described at all, since they have <i>none</i>. Both sexes go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>entirely naked,—if we except a little belt of three or
four inches in width, made from cotton or the bark of
trees, and called the <i>guayuco</i>, which they wear around
the waist,—but even this is worn from no motives of
modesty.</p>

<p class='c016'>What they regard in the light of a costume is a coat
of paint, and about this they are as nice and particular
as a Parisian dandy. Talk about “blooming up”
a faded <i>belle</i> for the ball-room, or the time spent by an
exquisite in adjusting the tie of his cravat! these are
trifles when compared with the lengthy and elaborate
toilette of an Ottomac lady or gentleman.</p>

<p class='c016'>The greater part of a day is often spent by them in a
single dressing, with one or two helpers to assist in the
operation; and this is not a <i>tattooing</i> process, intended to
last for a lifetime, but a costume certain to be disfigured,
or entirely washed off, at the first exposure to a heavy
shower of rain. Add to this, that the pigments which
are used for the purpose are by no means easily obtained:
the vegetable substances which furnish them
are scarce in the Ottomac country; and it costs one of
these Indians the produce of several days of his labor
to purchase sufficient paint to give his whole skin a single
“coat.” For this reason the Ottomac paints his body
only on grand occasions,—contenting himself at ordinary
times with merely staining his face and hair.</p>

<p class='c016'>When an Ottomac wishes to appear in “full dress”
he first gives himself a “priming” of red. This consists
of the dye called “annotto,” which is obtained from the
fruit pulp of the <i>Bixa orellana</i>, and which the Indians
knew how to prepare previous to their intercourse with
Europeans. Over this red ground is then formed a lattice-work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>of lines of black, with a dot in the centre of
every little square or diamond. The black dye is the
“caruto,” also a vegetable pigment, obtained from the
<i>Genipa Americana</i>. If the gentleman be rich enough
to possess a little “chica” which is a beautiful lake-colored
red,—also the produce of a plant,—the <i>Bignoni
chica</i>, he will then feel all the ecstatic delight of a fashionable
dandy who possesses a good wardrobe; and, with
half a pound of turtle-oil rubbed into his long black
tresses, he will regard himself as dressed “within an
inch of his life.” It is not always, however, that he can
afford the <i>chica</i>,—for it is one of the costliest materials
of which a South-American savage can manufacture his
suit.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Ottomac takes far less trouble in the building of
his house. Very often he builds none; but when he
wishes to guard his body from the rays of the sun, or
the periodical rains, he constructs him a slight edifice—a
mere hut—out of saplings or bamboos, with a
thatch of palm-leaves.</p>

<p class='c016'>His arms consist of the universal bow and arrows,
which he manages with much dexterity; and he has
also a harpoon which he employs in killing the manatee
and the alligator. He has, besides, several other
weapons, to aid him in the chase and fishing,—the latter
of which forms his principal employment as well as his
chief source of subsistence.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Ottomac belongs to one of those tribes of Indians
termed by the Spanish missionaries <i>Indios andantes</i>, that
is “wandering,” or “vagabond Indians,” who instead of
remaining in fixed and permanent villages, roam about
from place to place, as necessity or inclination dictates.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Perhaps this arises from the peculiarity of the country
which they inhabit: for the <i>Indios andantes</i> do not live
in the thick forests, but upon vast treeless savannas,
which stretch along the Orinoco above its great bend.
In these tracts the “juvia” trees (<i>bertholletia</i> and <i>lecythys</i>),
which produce the delicious “Brazil-nuts”—and
other plants that supply the savage spontaneously with
food, are sparsely found; and as the savannas are annually
inundated for several months, the Ottomac is
forced, whether he will or no, to shift his quarters and
try for subsistence elsewhere. When the inundations
have subsided and the waters become settled enough to
permit of fishing, the Ottomac “winter” is over, and he
can obtain food in plenty from the alligators, the manatees,
the turtles, the <i>toninas</i> or dolphins, and other
large fish that frequent the great stream upon which
he dwells. Of these the <i>manatee</i> is the most important
in the eyes of the Ottomac—as it is the largest in size,
and consequently furnishes him with the greatest amount
of meat.</p>

<p class='c016'>This singular semi-cetaceous creature is almost too
well known to require description. It is found in nearly
all the large rivers of tropical America, where it feeds
upon the grass and aquatic plants growing along their
banks. It is known by various names, according to the
place and people. The Spaniards call it <i>vaca marina</i>,
or “sea-cow,” and the Portuguese <i>peixe boi</i>, or “fish-ox,”—both
being appellations equally inappropriate, and
having their origin in a slight resemblance which there
exists between the animal’s “countenance” and that of
an ox.</p>

<p class='c016'>The West-Indian name is the one we have given,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>though the true orthography is <i>manati</i>, not <i>manatee</i>,
since the word is of Indian origin. Some writers deny
this, alleging that it is a derivative from the Spanish
word “mano,” a hand, signifying, therefore, the fish with
hands,—in allusion to the rudimentary hands which
form one of its distinguishing characteristics. This is
the account of the historian Oviedo, but another Spanish
missionary, Father Gili, offers a more correct explanation
of the name,—in fact, he proves, what is neither
more nor less than the simple truth, that “manati” was
the name given to this animal by the natives of Hayti
and Cuba,—where a species is also found,—and the
word has no reference whatever to the “hands” of the
creature. The resemblance to the Spanish word which
should signify “handed,” is merely an accidental circumstance;
and, as the acute Humboldt very justly remarks,
according to the genius of the Spanish language, the
word thus applied would have been written <i>manudo</i>,
or <i>manon</i>, and not <i>manati</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Indians have almost as many different names for
this creature as there are rivers in which it is found;
but its appellation in the “lingo ageral” of the great
Amazon valley, is “juarua.” Among the Ottomacs it
is called the “apoia.” It may be safely affirmed that
there are several species of this amphibious animal in
the rivers of tropical America; and possibly no one of
them is identical with that of the West Indies. All
have hitherto been regarded as belonging to the same
species, and described under the scientific title of <i>Manatus
Americanus</i>—a name given to the American
manati, to distinguish it from the “lamantin” of Africa,
and the “dugong” of the East-Indian seas. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>West-Indian species appears to have certain characteristic
differences, which shows that it is a separate one,
or, at all events, a variety. It is of much larger size
than those of the South-American rivers generally are—though
there also a large variety is found, but much
rarer than those commonly captured by the fishermen.
The West-Indian manati has nails well developed upon
the outer edge of its fins, or forearms; while those on
the other kinds are either not seen at all, or only in a
very rudimentary state. That there are different species,
may be deduced from the accounts of the natives,
who employ themselves in its capture: and the observations
of such people are usually more trustworthy
than the speculations of learned anatomists. The Amazon
fishermen all agree in the belief that there are
three kinds of manati in the Amazon and its numerous
tributaries, that not only differ greatly in size—from
seven to twenty feet long—and in weight, from four
hundred to two thousand pounds,—but also in the color
of their skin, and the shape of their tails and fins. The
species found in the Orinoco, and called “apoia” by the
Ottomacs, is usually about twelve feet in length, and
weighs from five hundred to eight hundred pounds; but
now and then a much larger individual is captured, perhaps
owing to greater age, or other accidental circumstance.
Humboldt heard of one that weighed eight
thousand pounds; and the French naturalist D’Orbigny
speaks of one killed in the Bolivian waters of the
Amazon that was twenty feet in length. This size is
often attained by the <i>Manatus Americanus</i> of Cuba and
Hayti.</p>

<p class='c016'>The manati is shaped somewhat like a huge seal, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>has certain resemblances to a fish. Its body is of an
oval oblong, with a large, flat, rounded tail, set horizontally,
and which serves as a rudder to direct its course
in the water. Just behind its shoulders appear, instead
of fins, a pair of flippers, which have a certain resemblance
to hands set on to the body without arms. Of
these it avails itself, when creeping out against the bank,
and the female also uses them in carrying her young.
The mammæ (for it must be remembered that this creature
is a mammiferous animal) are placed just below and
behind the flippers. The muzzle is blunt, with thick
lips,—the upper projecting several inches beyond the
lower, and covered with a delicate epidermis: showing
evidently that it avails itself of this prominence—which
possesses a keen sense of touch—just as the elephant
of his proboscis. The lips are covered with bristles, or
beard, which impart a kind of human-like expression to
the animal’s countenance,—a circumstance more observable
in the “dugongs” of the Oriental waters.
“Woman-fish,” too, these have been called, and no doubt
such creatures, along with the seals and walruses, have
given rise to many a story of sirens and mermaids. The
“cow-face,” however, from which the manati obtains its
Spanish and Portuguese epithets, is the most characteristic;
and in its food we find a still greater analogy
to the bovine quadruped with which it is brought in
comparison. Beyond this the resemblance ceases. The
body is that of a seal; but instead of being covered with
hair, as the cetaceous animal, the manati has a smooth
skin that resembles india-rubber more than anything
else. A few short hairs are set here and there, but
they are scarce observable. The color of the manati is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>that of lead, with a few mottlings of a pinkish-white hue
upon the belly; but in this respect there is no uniformity.
Some are seen with the whole under-parts of a
uniform cream-color.</p>

<p class='c016'>The lungs of this animal present a peculiarity worthy
of being noted. They are very voluminous,—being
sometimes three feet in length, and of such a porous and
elastic nature as to be capable of immense extension.
When blown out, they present the appearance of great
swimming bladders; and it is by means of this capacity
for containing air that, the manati is enabled to remain
so long under water,—though, like the true <i>cetaceæ</i>, it
requires to come at intervals to the surface to obtain
breath.</p>

<p class='c016'>The flesh of the manati is eaten by all the tribes of
Indians who can procure it,—though by some it is
more highly esteemed than by others. It was once
much relished in the colonial settlements of Guiana and
the West Indies, and formed a considerable article of
commerce; but in these quarters manatis have grown
scarce,—from the incessant persecution of the fishermen.
The flesh has been deemed unwholesome by
some, and apt to produce fevers; but this is not the
general opinion. It has a greater resemblance to pork
than beef,—though it be the flesh of a cow,—and is
very savory when fresh, though neither is it bad eating
when salted or dried in the sun. In this way it will
keep for several months; and it has always been a stock
article with the monks of the South-American missions,—who,
in spite of its mammiferous character, find it
convenient, during the days of Lent, to regard it as a
<i>fish</i>. The skin of the manati is of exceeding thickness,—on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the back an inch and a half at least, though
it becomes thinner as it approaches the under-parts of
the body. It is cut into slips which serve various purposes,
as for shields, cordage, and whips. “These whips
of manati leather,” says Humboldt, “are a cruel instrument
of punishment for the unhappy slaves, and even
for the Indians of the missions, though, according to the
laws, the latter ought to be treated as freemen.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Another valuable commodity obtained from this animal
is oil, known in the missions as manati-butter (<i>manteca
de manati</i>). This is produced by the layer of pure fat,
of an inch and a half in thickness, which, lying immediately
under the skin, envelops the whole body of the
animal. The oil is used for lamps in the mission
churches; but among the Indians themselves it is also
employed in the <i>cuisine</i>,—as it has not that fetid smell
peculiar to the oil of whales and salt-water cetaceæ.</p>

<p class='c016'>The food of the manati is grass exclusively, which it
finds on the banks of the lakes and rivers it frequents.
Of this it will eat an enormous quantity; and its usual
time of browsing is at night,—though this habit may
have arisen from its observance of the fact, that night is
the safest time to approach the shore. In those places,
where is has been left undisturbed, it may be often seen
browsing by day.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have been thus particular in my account of this
animal, because it is more nearly connected with the
history of Ottomac habits than perhaps that of any
other tribe of South-American Indian,—the Guamos
alone excepted, who may themselves be regarded as
merely a branch of the Ottomac family. Though, as
already remarked, all the tribes who dwell upon manati
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>rivers pursue this creature and feed upon its flesh, yet
in no other part of South America is this species of
fishery so extensively or so dexterously carried on as
among the Ottomacs and Guamos,—the reason being,
that, amidst the great grassy savannas which characterize
the Ottomac country, there are numerous streams
and lagoons that are the favorite haunts of this herbivorous
animal. In one river in particular, so great a
number are found that it has been distinguished by the
appellation of the <i>Rio de Manatis</i> (river of manatis).
The manati, when undisturbed, is gregarious in its
habits, going in troops (or “herds,” if we preserve the
analogy) of greater or less numbers, and keeping the
young “calves” in the centre, which the mothers guard
with the tenderest affection. So attached are the parents
to their young, that if the calf be taken, the mother can
be easily approached; and the devotion is reciprocated
on the filial side; since in cases where the mother has
been captured and dragged ashore, the young one has
often been known to follow the lifeless body up to the
very bank!</p>

<p class='c016'>As the manati plays such an important part in the
domestic economy of the Ottomacs, of course the capturing
of this animal is carried on upon the grandest
scale among these people, and, like the “harvest of
turtle-eggs,” hereafter to be described, the manati fishery
has its particular <i>season</i>. Some writers have erroneously
stated this season as being the period of inundation,
and when the water is at its maximum height.
This is quite contrary to the truth; since that period,
both on the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, is just the time
when all kinds of fishing is difficult and precarious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Then is the true winter,—the “blue months” of the
South-American river Indians; and it is then, as will
presently be seen, that the Ottomac comes nearest the
point of starvation,—which he approaches every year
of his life.</p>

<p class='c016'>There are manati and other kinds of fish taken at all
times of the year; but the true season of the manati-fishing
is when the waters of the great flood have considerably
subsided, and are still continuing to diminish
rapidly. When the inundation is at its height, the manati
passes out of the channel current of the great river, and
in search of grass it finds its way into the lakes and
surrounding marshes, remaining there to browse along
their banks. When the flood is rapidly passing away
from it, it begins to find itself a “little out of its element,”
and just then is the time when it is most easily
captured.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sometimes the Indians assemble in a body with their
canoes, forming a large fleet; and, proceeding to the
best haunts of the “cow-fish,” carry on the fishery in
a wholesale manner. The monks of the missions also
head the <i>tame</i> tribes on these expeditions,—as they do
when collecting the eggs of the turtle,—and a regular
systematic course is carried on under the eye of discipline
and authority. A camp is formed at some convenient
place on the shore. Scaffolds are erected for
sun-drying the flesh and skins; and vessels and other
utensils brought upon the ground to render the fat into
oil. The manatis that have been captured are all brought
in the canoes to this central point, and delivered up to
be “<i>flensed</i>,” cured, and cooked. There is the usual
assemblage of small traders from Angostura and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>ports on the lower Orinoco, who come to barter their
Indian trinkets for the <i>manteca de manati</i> in the same
manner it will presently be seen they trade for the
<i>manteca de tortugas</i>. I need not add that this is a season
of joy and festivity, like the wine-gatherings and
harvest-homes of the European peasantry.</p>

<p class='c016'>The mode of capturing the manati is very similar to
that employed by the Esquimaux in taking the seal, and
which has been elsewhere described. There is not much
danger in the fishery, for no creature could be more
harmless and inoffensive than this. It makes not the
slightest attempt either at defence or retaliation,—though
the accident sometimes occurs of a canoe being
swamped or drawn under water,—but this is nothing
to the Ottomac Indian, who is almost as amphibious
as the manati itself.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the proper hour the fisherman starts off in search
of the manati. His fishing-boat is a canoe hollowed
from a single trunk, of that kind usually styled a “dug-out.”
On perceiving the cow-fish resting upon the surface
of the water, the Ottomac paddles towards it, observing
the greatest caution; for although the organs of
sight and hearing in this animal are, externally, but very
little developed, it both hears and sees well; and the
slightest suspicious noise would be a signal for it to dive
under, and of course escape.</p>

<p class='c016'>When near enough to insure a good aim, the Ottomac
hurls his harpoon into the animal’s body; which, after
piercing the thick hide, sticks fast. To this harpoon a
cord is attached, with a float, and the float remaining
above water indicates the direction in which the wounded
animal now endeavors to get off. When it is tired of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>struggling, the Indian regains the cord; and taking it
in, hand over hand, draws up his canoe to the side of
the fish. If it be still too lively, he repeatedly strikes
it with a spear; but he does not aim to kill it outright
until he has got it “aboard.” Once there, he ends the
creature’s existence by driving a wooden plug into its
nostrils, which in a moment deprives it of life.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Ottomac now prepares himself to transport the
carcass to his home; or, if fishing in company, to the
common rendezvous. Perhaps he has some distance to
take it, and against a current; and he finds it inconvenient
to tow such a heavy and cumbrous article. To
remedy this inconvenience, he adopts the expedient
already mentioned, of placing the carcass in his canoe.
But how does he get it there? How can a single Indian
of ordinary strength raise a weight of a thousand pounds
out of the water, and lift it over the gunwale of his unsteady
craft? It is in this that he exhibits great cunning
and address: for instead of raising the carcass
above the canoe, he sinks the canoe below the carcass,
by first filling the vessel nearly full of water; and then,
after he has got his freight aboard, he bales out the
water with his gourd-shell. He at length succeeds in
adjusting his load, and then paddles homeward with his
prize.</p>

<p class='c016'>On arriving at his village,—if it be to the village he
takes it,—he is assisted in transporting the load by
others of his tribe; but he does not carry it to his own
house,—for the Ottomacs are true socialists, and the
produce both of the chase and the fishery is the common
property of all. The chief of the village, seated in front
of his hut, receives all that is brought home, and distributes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>it out to the various heads of families,—giving
to each in proportion to the number of mouths that are
to be fed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The manati is flayed,—its thick hide, as already observed,
serving for many useful purposes; the strata of
fat, or “blubber,” which lies beneath is removed, to be
converted into oil; and finally, the flesh, which is esteemed
equal to pork, both in delicacy and flavor, is cut
into thin slices, either to be broiled and eaten at the time,
or to be preserved for a future occasion, not by salt, of
which the Ottomac is entirely ignorant, but by drying in
the sun and smoking over a slow fire. Fish and the
flesh of the alligator are similarly “cured;” and when
the process is carefully done, both will keep for months.</p>

<p class='c016'>The alligator is captured in various ways: sometimes
by a baited hook with a strong cord attached,—sometimes
he is killed by a stab of the harpoon-spear, and
not unfrequently is he taken by a noose slipped over his
paw, the Ottomac diving fearlessly under him and adjusting
the snare.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some of the Indian tribes will not eat the musky flesh
of the alligator; but the Ottomacs are not thus particular.
Indeed, these people refuse scarce any article of
food, however nasty or disagreeable; and it is a saying
among their neighbors—the Indians of other tribes—that
“nothing is too loathsome for the stomach of an
Ottomac.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps the saying will be considered as perfectly
true when we come to describe a species of food which
these people eat, and which, for a long time, has rendered
them famous—or rather infamous—under the
appellation of “dirt-eaters.” Of them it may literally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>be said that they “eat dirt,” for such, in reality, is one
of their customs.</p>

<p class='c016'>This singular practice is chiefly resorted to during
those months in the year when the rivers swell to their
greatest height, and continue full. At this time all
fishing ceases, and the Ottomac finds it difficult to obtain
a sufficiency of food. To make up for the deficiency, he
fills his stomach with a kind of unctuous clay, which he
has already stored up for the emergency, and of which
he eats about a pound per diem! It does not constitute
his sole diet, but often for several days together it is
the only food which passes his lips! There is nothing
nourishing in it,—that has been proved by analysis.
It merely <i>fills</i> the belly,—producing a satiety, or, at
least, giving some sort of relief from the pangs of hunger.
Nor has it been observed that the Ottomac grows thin or
unhealthy on this unnatural viand: on the contrary, he
is one of the most robust and healthy of American
Indians.</p>

<p class='c016'>The earth which the Ottomac eats goes by the name
of <i>poya</i>. He does not eat clay of every kind: only a
peculiar sort which he finds upon the banks of streams.
It is soft and smooth to the touch, and unctuous, like
putty. In its natural state it is of a yellowish-gray
color; but, when hardened before the fire, it assumes a
tinge of red, owing to the oxide of iron which is in it.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was for a long time believed that the Ottomac
mixed this clay with cassava and turtle-oil, or some
other sort of nutritive substance. Even Father Gumilla—who
was credulous enough to believe almost anything—could
not “swallow” the story of the clay in
its natural state, but believed that it was prepared with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>some combination of farinha or fat. This, however, is
not the case. It is a pure earth, containing (according
to the analysis of Vauquelin) silex and alumina, with
three or four per cent of lime!</p>

<p class='c016'>This clay the Ottomac stores up, forming it into balls
of several inches in diameter; which, being slightly hardened
before the fire, he builds into little pyramids, just
as cannon-balls are piled in an arsenal or fortress.
When the Ottomac wishes to eat of the <i>poya</i>, he softens
one of the balls by wetting it; and then, scraping off as
much as he may require for his meal, returns the <i>poya</i>
to its place on the pyramid.</p>

<p class='c016'>The dirt-eating does not entirely end with the falling
of the waters. The practice has begot a craving for it;
and the Ottomac is not contented without a little <i>poya</i>,
even when more nutritious food may be obtained in
abundance.</p>

<p class='c016'>This habit of eating earth is not exclusively Ottomac.
Other kindred tribes indulge in it, though not to so great
an extent; and we find the same unnatural practice
among the savages of New Caledonia and the Indian
archipelago. It is also common on the west coast of
Africa. Humboldt believed it to be exclusively a tropical
habit. In this the great philosopher was in error, since
it is known to be practised by some tribes of northern
Indians on the frigid banks of the Mackenzie River.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the floods subside, as already stated, the Ottomac
lives better. Then he can obtain both fish and
turtles in abundance. The former he captures, both
with hooks and nets, or shoots with his arrows, when
they rise near the surface.</p>

<p class='c016'>The turtles of the Ottomac rivers are of two kinds:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>the <i>arau</i> and <i>terecay</i>. The former is the one most
sought after, as being by far the largest. It is nearly a
yard across the back, and weighs from fifty to a hundred
pounds. It is a shy creature, and would be difficult
to capture, were it not for a habit it has of raising its
head above the surface of the water, and thus exposing
the soft part of its throat to the Indian’s arrow. Even
then an arrow might fail to kill it; but the Ottomac
takes care to have the point well coated with <i>curare</i>
poison, which in a few seconds does its work, and secures
the death of the victim.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>terecay</i> is taken in a different and still more
ingenious manner. This species, floating along the surface,
or even when lying still, presents no mark at which
a shaft can be aimed with the slightest chance of success.
The sharpest arrow would glance off its flat shelly back
as from a surface of steel. In order, therefore, to reach
the vitals of his victim, the Indian adopts an expedient,
in which he exhibits a dexterity and skill that are truly
remarkable.</p>

<p class='c016'>He aims his shaft, not at the turtle, but up into the
air, describing by its course a parabolic curve, and so
calculating its velocity and direction that it will drop
perpendicularly, point foremost, upon the back of the
unsuspecting swimmer, and pierce through the shell right
into the vital veins of its body!</p>

<p class='c016'>It is rare that an Indian will fail in hitting such a
mark; and, both on the Orinoco and Amazon, thousands
of turtles are obtained in this manner.</p>

<p class='c016'>The great season of Ottomac festivity and rejoicing,
however, is that of the <i>cosecha de tortugas</i>, or “turtle-crop.”
As has been already observed, in relation to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>manati fishery, it is to him what the harvest-home is to
the nations of northern Europe, or the wine-gathering to
those of the south; for this is more truly the character
of the <i>cosecha</i>. It is then that he is enabled, not only
to procure a supply of turtle-oil with which to lubricate
his hair and skin, but he obtains enough of this delicious
grease wherewith to fry his dried slices of manati, and a
surplus for sale to the turtle-traders from the Lower
Orinoco. In this petty commerce no coin is required;
harpoon-spears, and arrow-heads of iron, rude knives,
and hachets; but, above all, a few cakes of <i>annotto
chica</i>, and <i>caruto</i>, are bartered in exchange for the
turtle-oil. The thick hide of the manati,—for making
slave-whips,—the spotted skin of the jaguar, and some
other pelts which the chase produces, are also items of
his export trade.</p>

<p class='c016'>The pigments above mentioned have already been
procured by the trader, as the <i>export</i> articles of commerce
of some other tribe.</p>

<p class='c016'>The turtle-oil is the product of the eggs of the larger
species,—the <i>arau</i>,—known simply by the name <i>tortuga</i>,
or turtle. The eggs of the <i>terecay</i> would serve
equally as well; but, from a difference in the habit of
this animal, its eggs cannot be obtained in sufficient
quantity for oil-making. There is no such thing as a
grand “cosecha,” or crop of them—for the creature is
not gregarious, like its congener, but each female makes
her nest apart from the others, in some solitary place,
and there brings forth her young brood. Not but that
the nests of the <i>terecay</i> are also found and despoiled of
their eggs,—but this only occurs at intervals; and as
the contents of a single nest would not be sufficient for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>a “churning,” no “butter” can be made of them. They
are, therefore, gathered to be used only as <i>eggs</i>, and not
as <i>butter</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>arau</i>, on the other hand, although not gregarious
under ordinary circumstances, becomes pre-eminently so
during the “laying season.” Then all the turtles in the
Orinoco and its tributaries collect into three or four vast
gangs—numbering in all over a million of individuals—and
proceed to certain points of rendezvous which
they have been in the habit of visiting from time immemorial.
These common breeding-places are situated
between the cataracts of the river and the great bend,
where it meets the Apure; and are simply broad beaches
of sand, rising with a gentle slope from the edge of
the water, and extending for miles along the bank.
There are some small rookeries on tributary streams,
but the three most noted are upon the shores of the
main river, between the points already indicated. That
frequented by the Ottomacs is upon an island, at the
mouth of the Uruana River, upon which these people
principally dwell.</p>

<p class='c016'>The laying season of the <i>arau</i> turtle varies in the
different rivers of tropical America,—occurring in the
Amazon and its tributaries at a different period from
that of the Orinoco. It is regulated by the rise, or
rather the fall of the inundations; and takes place
when the waters, at their lowest stage, have laid bare
the low sand-banks upon the shores. This occurs (in
the Orinoco) in March, and early in this month the
great assemblages are complete. For weeks before,
the turtles are seen, in all parts of the river near the
intended breeding-places, swimming about on the surface,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>or basking along the banks. As the sun grows
stronger, the desire of depositing their eggs increases,—as
though the heat had something to do with their
fecundation. For some time before the final action, the
creatures may be seen ranged in a long line in front of
the breeding-place, with their heads and necks held high
above the water; as if contemplating their intended
nursery, and calculating the dangers to which they may
be exposed. It is not without reason that they may
dwell upon these. Along the beach stalks the lordly
jaguar, waiting to make a meal of the first that may set
his foot on terra firma, or to fill his stomach with the
delicious “new-laid” eggs. The ugly alligator, too, is
equally <i>friand</i> of a gigantic omelette; and not less so
the “garzas” (white cranes) and the “zamuros” (black
vultures), who hover in hundreds in the air. Here
and there, too, may be observed an Indian sentinel,
keeping as much as possible out of sight of the turtles
themselves, but endeavoring to drive off all other enemies
whose presence may give them fear. Should a
canoe or boat appear upon the river, it is warned by
these sentinels to keep well off from the phalanx of the
turtles,—lest these should be disturbed or alarmed,—for
the Indian well knows that if anything should occur
to produce a panic among the araus, his <i>cosecha</i> would
be very much shortened thereby.</p>

<p class='c016'>When at length the turtles have had sun enough to
warm them to the work, they crawl out upon the dry
sand-beach, and the laying commences. It is at night
that the operation is carried on: for then their numerous
enemies—especially the vultures—are less active,
Each turtle scoops out a hole, of nearly a yard in diameter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>and depth; and having therein deposited from fifty
to one hundred eggs, it covers them up with the sand,
smoothing the surface, and treading it firmly down.
Sometimes the individuals are so crowded as to lay in
one another’s nests, breaking many of the eggs, and
causing an inextricable confusion; while the creaking
noise of their shells rubbing against each other may be
heard afar off, like the rushing of a cataract. Sometimes
a number that have arrived late, or have been slow at
their work, continue engaged in it till after daybreak,
and even after the Indians have come upon the ground—whose
presence they no longer regard. Impelled by
the instinct of philoprogenitiveness, these “mad turtles,”
as the Indians call them, appear utterly regardless of
danger, and make no effort to escape from it; but are
turned over on their backs, or killed upon the spot
without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c016'>The beach being now deserted by the turtles, the egg-gatherers
proceed to their work. As there are usually
several tribes, who claim a share in the <i>cosecha</i>, the
ground is measured out, and partitioned among them.
The regularity with which the nests are placed, and
the number of eggs in each being pretty nearly the
same, an average estimate of the quantity under a
given surface is easily made. By means of a pointed
stick thrust into the sand, the outline of the deposit is
ascertained—usually running along the beach in a strip
of about thirty yards in breadth.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the allotments are determined, the work of
oil-making begins,—each tribe working by itself, and
upon the social system. The covering of sand is removed,
and the eggs placed in baskets, which are then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>emptied into large wooden troughs, as a common receptacle.
The canoes, drawn up on the sand, are frequently
made to do duty as troughs. When a sufficient
number of eggs have been thrown in, they are broken
and pounded together, and whipped about, as if intended
for a gigantic omelette. Water is added; and then the
mixture is put into large caldrons, and boiled until the
oil comes to the top; after which it is carefully skimmed
off and poured into earthern jars (“botigas,”) provided
by the traders.</p>

<p class='c016'>It takes about two weeks to complete the operations,
during which time many curious scenes occur. The
sand swarms with young turtles about as big as a dollar,
which have been prematurely hatched; and have
contrived to crawl out of the shell. These are chased
in all directions, and captured by the little naked Ottomacs,
who devour them “body, bones, and all,” with as
much gusto as if they were gooseberries. The cranes
and vultures, and young alligators too, take a part in
this by-play—for the offspring of the poor arau has no
end of enemies.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the oil is all boiled and bottled, the trader displays
his tempting wares, and makes the best market he
can; and the savage returns to his palm-hut village,—taking
with him the articles of exchange and a few
baskets of eggs, which he has reserved for his own eating;
and so ends the <i>cosecha de tortugas</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is in this season that the Ottomac indulges most in
good living, and eats the smallest quantity of dirt. The
waters afford him abundance of fish and turtle-flesh,
beef from the sea-cow, and steaks from the tail of the
alligator. He has his turtle and manati butter, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>to fry all these dainties, and also to lubricate his hair and
skin.</p>

<p class='c016'>He can dress, too, “within an inch of his life,” having
obtained for his oil a fresh supply of the precious pigments.
He indulges, moreover, in fits of intoxication,
caused by a beverage made from maize or manioc root;
but oftener produced by a species of snuff which he inhales
into his nostrils. This is the <i>niopo</i>, manufactured
from the leaves of a <i>mimosa</i>, and mixed with a kind of
lime, which last is obtained by burning a shell of the
genus <i>helix</i>, that is found in the waters of the Orinoco.
The effect of the <i>niopo</i> resembles that produced by chewing
<i>betel</i>, tobacco, opium, or the narcotic <i>coca</i> of Peru.
When freely taken, a species of intoxication or rather
mania is produced; but this snuff and its effects are
more minutely described elsewhere. It is here introduced
because, in the case of the Ottomac, the drug often
produces most baneful consequences. During the continuance
of his intoxication the Ottomac is quarrelsome
and disorderly. He picks a hole in the coat of his
neighbor; but if there chance to be any “old sore”
between him and a rival, the vindictive feeling is sure to
exhibit itself on these occasions; and not unfrequently
ends in an encounter, causing the death of one or both
of the combatants. These duels are not fought either
with swords or pistols, knives, clubs, nor any similar
weapons. The destruction of the victim is brought
about in a very different manner; and is the result of
a very slight scratch which he has received during the
fight from the <i>nail</i> of his antagonist. That a wound of so
trifling a nature should prove mortal would be something
very mysterious, did we not know that the nail which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>inflicted that scratch has been already enfiltrated with
<i>curare</i>,—one of the deadliest of vegetable poisons,
which the Ottomac understands how to prepare in its
most potent and virulent form.</p>

<p class='c016'>Should it ever be your unfortunate fate therefore, to
get into a “scrimmage” with an Ottomac Indian, you
must remember to keep clear of his “claws”!</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE COMANCHES, OR PRAIRIE INDIANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>Young reader, I need scarce tell you that the noblest
of animals—the horse—is not indigenous to
America. You already know that when Columbus discovered
the New World, no animal of the horse kind
was found there; and yet the geologist has proved incontestably
that at one time horses existed in the New
World,—at a period too, geologically speaking, not very
remote. The fossilized bones examined by one of the
most accomplished of modern travellers—Dr. Darwin—establish
this truth beyond a doubt.</p>

<p class='c016'>The horse that at present inhabits America, though
not indigenous, has proved a flourishing exotic. Not
only in a domestic state has he increased in numbers,
but he has in many places escaped from the control of
man, and now runs wild upon the great plains both of
North and South America. Although you may find in
America almost every “breed” of horses known in Europe,
yet the great majority belong to two very distinct
kinds. The first of these is the large English horse, in
his different varieties, imported by the Anglo-Americans,
and existing almost exclusively in the woodland territory
of the United States. The second kind is the Andalusian-Arab,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>horse of the Spanish conquerors,—a
much smaller breed than the English-Arabian, but quite
equal to him in mettle and beauty of form. It is the
Andalusian horse that is found throughout all Spanish
America,—it is he that has multiplied to such a wonderful
extent,—it is he that has “run wild.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That the horse in his normal state is a dweller upon
open plains, is proved by his habits in America,—for
in no part where the forest predominates is he found
wild,—only upon the prairies of the north, and the
llanos and pampas of the south, where a timbered tract
forms the exception.</p>

<p class='c016'>He must have found these great steppes congenial to
his natural disposition,—since, only a very short time
after the arrival of the Spaniards in the New World, we
find the horse a runaway from civilization,—not only
existing in a wild state upon the prairies, but in possession
of many of the Indian tribes.</p>

<p class='c016'>It would be an interesting inquiry to trace the change
of habits which the possession of the horse must have
occasioned among these Arabs of the Western world.
However hostile they may have been to his European
rider, they must have welcomed the horse as a friend.
No doubt they admired the bold, free spirit of the noble
animal so analogous to their own nature. He and they
soon became inseparable companions; and have continued
so from that time to the present hour. Certain it
is that the prairie, or “horse-Indians” of the present
day, are in many respects essentially different from the
staid and stoical sons of the forest so often depicted in
romances; and almost equally certain is it, that the possession
of the horse has contributed much to bring about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>this dissimilarity. It could not be otherwise. With the
horse new habits were introduced,—new manners and
customs,—new modes of thought and action. Not only
the chase, but war itself, became a changed game,—to
be played in an entirely different manner.</p>

<p class='c016'>We shall not go back to inquire what these Indians
<i>were</i> when afoot. It is our purpose only to describe
what they <i>are</i> now that they are on horseback. Literally,
may we say <i>on horseback</i>; for, unless at this
present writing they are asleep, we may safely take it
for granted they are upon the backs of their horses,—young
and old of them, rich and poor,—for there is
none of them so poor as not to be the master of a
“mustang” steed.</p>

<p class='c016'>In “Prairie-land” every tribe of Indians is in possession
of the horse. On the north the Crees, Crows,
and Blackfeet, the Sioux, Cheyennes, and Arapahoes;
on the plains of the Platte, the Kansas, and Osage, we
find the Pawnees, the Kansas, and Osages,—all horse-Indians.
West of the great mountain-range, the Apache
is mounted: so likewise the Utah, the Navajo, and
the Snake, or Shoshonee,—the latter rather sparingly.
Other tribes, to a greater or less degree, possess this
valuable animal; but the true type of the “horse-Indian”
is to be found in the Comanche, the lord of
that wide domain that extends from the Arkansas to
the Rio Grande. He it is who gives trouble to the
frontier colonists of Texas, and equally harasses the
Spanish settlements of New Mexico; he it is who carries
his forays almost into the heart of New Spain,—even
to the gates of the populous Durango.</p>

<p class='c016'>Regarding the Comanche, then, as the type of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>horse-Indians, we shall speak more particularly of him.
Allowing for some slight difference in the character of
his climate and country, his habits and customs will be
found not very dissimilar to those of the other tribes
who make the prairie their home.</p>

<p class='c016'>To say that the Comanche is the finest horseman in
the world would be to state what is not the fact. He
is not more excellent in this accomplishment than his
neighbor and bitter foeman, the Pawnee,—no better
than the “vaquero” of California, the “ranchero” of
Mexico, the “llanero” of Venezuela, the “gaucho” of
Buenos Ayres, and the horse-Indians of the “Gran
Chaco” of Paraguay, of the Pampas, and Patagonia.
He is <i>equal</i>, however, to any of these, and that is saying
enough,—in a word, that he takes rank among the
finest horsemen in the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Comanche is on horseback almost from the hour
of infancy,—transferred, as it were, from his mother’s
arms to the withers of a mustang. When able to walk,
he is scarce allowed to practise this natural mode of
progression, but performs all his movements on the
back of a horse. A Comanche would no more think of
making a journey afoot—even if it were only to the
distance of a few hundred yards—than he would of
crawling upon his hands and knees. The horse, ready
saddled and bridled, stands ever near,—it differs little
whether there is either saddle or bridle,—and flinging
himself on the animal’s back, or his neck, or his croup,
or hanging suspended along his side, the Indian guides
him to the destined spot, usually at a rapid gallop. It
is of no consequence to the rider how fast the horse
may be going: it will not hinder him from mounting or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>dismounting at will. At any time, by clutching the
mane, he can spring upon the horse’s shoulders,—just
as may be often seen in the arena of the circus.</p>

<p class='c016'>The horse-Indian is a true type of the <i>nomadic</i> races,—a
dweller in tents, which his four-footed associate
enables him to transport from place to place with the
utmost facility. Some of the tribes, however, and even
some of the Comanches, have fixed residences, or “villages,”
where at a certain season of the year they—or
rather their women—cultivate the maize, the pumpkin,
the melon, the calabash, and a few other species of
plants,—all being vegetable products indigenous to their
country. No doubt, before the arrival of Europeans,
this cultivation was carried on more extensively than
at present; but the possession of the horse has enabled
the prairie tribes to dispense with a calling which they
cordially contemn: the calling of the husbandman.</p>

<p class='c016'>These misguided savages, one and all, regard agricultural
pursuits as unworthy of men; and wherever
necessity compels them to practise them, the work falls
to the lot of the women and slaves,—for be it known
that the Comanche is a slave-owner; and holds in bondage
not only Indians of other tribes, but also a large
number of mestizoes and whites of the Spanish race,
captured during many a sanguinary raid into the settlements
of Mexico! It would be easy to show that it
is this false pride of being hunters and warriors, with
its associated aversion for an agricultural life, that has
thinned the numbers of the Indian race—far more
than any persecution they have endured at the hands
of the white man. This it is that starves them, that
makes unendurable neighbors of them, and has rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>it necessary in some instances to “civilize them off the
face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But they are not yet all civilized from off the face of
the earth; nor is it their destiny to disappear so readily
as short-seeing prophets have declared. Their idle
habits and internecine wars have done much to thin
their numbers,—far more than the white man’s hostility,—but
wherever the white man has stepped in
and put a stop to their tribal contentions,—wherever
he has succeeded in conquering their aversion to industrial
pursuits,—the Indian is found not only to hold his
ground, but to increase rapidly in numbers. This is the
case with many tribes,—Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees,—so
that I can promise you, young reader, that
by the time you get to be an old man, there will be
as many Indians in the world as upon that day when
Columbus first set his foot upon “Cat” Island.</p>

<p class='c016'>You will be inquiring how the horse could render the
prairie Indian more independent of agriculture? The
answer is simple. With this valuable auxiliary a new
mode of subsistence was placed within his reach. An
article of food, which he had hitherto been able to obtain
only in a limited quantity, was now procurable in
abundance,—the flesh of the buffalo.</p>

<p class='c016'>The prairies of North America have their own peculiarities.
They are not stocked with large droves of
ruminant animals, as the plains of Southern Africa,—where
the simplest savage may easily obtain a dinner
of flesh-meat. A few species of deer, thinly distributed,—all
swift, shy animals,—the prong-horn antelope, still
swifter and shier,—and the “big-horn,” shiest of all,—were
the only ruminants of Prairie-land, with the exception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>of the great bison, or buffalo, as he is generally
called. But even this last was not so easily captured in
those days. The bison, though not a swift runner, is yet
more than a match for the biped man; and though the
Indian might steal upon the great drove, and succeed in
bringing down a few with his arrows, it was not always
a sure game. Moreover, afoot, the hunter could not
follow the buffalo in its grand migrations,—often extending
for hundreds of miles across plains, rivers,
and ravines. Once mounted, the circumstances became
changed. The Indian hunter could not only overtake
the buffalo, but ride round him at will, and pursue him,
if need be, to the most distant parts of Prairie-land.
The result, therefore, of the introduction of the horse
was a plentiful supply of buffalo-meat, or, when that
failed, the flesh of the horse himself,—upon which two
articles of diet the prairie Indian has almost exclusively
subsisted ever since.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Comanche has several modes of hunting the
buffalo. If alone, and he wishes to make a grand <i>coup</i>,
he will leave his horse at a distance,—the animal being
trained to remain where his master has left him. The
hunter then approaches the herd with great caution,
keeping to leeward,—lest he might be “winded” by
the old sentinel bulls who keep watch. Should there
be no cover to shelter the approach of the hunter, the
result would be that the bulls would discover him; and,
giving out their bellow of alarm, cause the others to
scamper off.</p>

<p class='c016'>To guard against this, the Indian has already prepared
himself by adopting a <i>ruse</i>,—which consists in
disguising himself in the skin of a buffalo, horns and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>all complete, and approaching the herd, as if he were
some stray individual that had been left behind, and was
just on the way to join its fellows. Even the motions
of the buffalo, when browsing, are closely imitated by
the red hunter; and, unless the wind be in favor of his
being scented by the bulls, this device will insure the
success of a shot. Sometimes the skin of the large
whitish-gray wolf is used in this masquerade with equal
success. This may appear singular, since the animal
itself is one of the deadliest enemies of the buffalo: a
large pack of them hanging on the skirts of every herd,
and patiently waiting for an opportunity to attack it. But
as this attack is only directed against the younger calves,—or
some disabled or decrepit individual who may lag
behind,—the strong and healthy ones have no fear of
the wolves, and permit them to squat upon the prairie
within a few feet of where they are browsing! Indeed,
they could not hinder them, even if they wished: as the
long-legged wolf in a few springs can easily get out of
the way of the more clumsy ruminant; and, therefore,
does not dread the lowering frontlet of the most shaggy
and ill-tempered bull in the herd.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course the hunter, in the guise of a wolf, obtains
the like privilege of close quarters; and, when he has arrived
at the proper distance for his purpose, he prepares
himself for the work of destruction. The bow is the
weapon he uses,—though the rifle is now a common
weapon in the hands of many of the horse-Indians.
But the bow is preferred for the species of “still hunting”
here described. The first crack of a rifle would
scatter the gang, leaving the hunter perhaps only an
empty gun for his pains; while an arrow at such close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>quarters is equally as deadly in its effect; and, being a
<i>silent</i> weapon, no alarm is given to any of the buffaloes,
except that one which has felt the deadly shaft passing
through its vitals.</p>

<p class='c016'>Often the animal thus shot—even when the wound
is a mortal one—does not immediately fall; but sinks
gradually to the earth, as if lying down for a rest.
Sometimes it gets only to its knees, and dies in this
attitude; at other times it remains a long while upon its
legs, spreading its feet widely apart, as if to prop itself
up, and then rocking from side to side like a ship in a
ground-swell, till at last, weakened by loss of blood, it
yields its body to the earth. Sometimes the struggles
of a wounded individual cause the herd to “stampede,”
and then the hunter has to content himself with what he
may already have shot; but not unfrequently the unsuspicious
gang keeps the ground till the Indian has
emptied his quiver. Nay, longer than that: for it often
occurs that the disguised buffalo or wolf (as the case
may be) approaches the bodies of those that have fallen,
recovers some of his arrows, and uses them a second
time with like deadly effect! For this purpose it is his
practice, if the aim and distance favor him, to send his
shaft clear through the body of the bison, in order that
the barb may not hinder it from being extracted on the
other side! This feat is by no means of uncommon
occurrence among the buffalo-hunters of the prairies.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course, a grand wholesale slaughter of the kind
just described is not an every-day matter; and can only
be accomplished when the buffaloes are in a state of
comparative rest, or browsing slowly. More generally
they detect the dangerous counterfeit in time to save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>their skins; or else keep moving too rapidly for the
hunter to follow them on foot. His only resource, then,
is to ride rapidly up on horseback, fire his arrows without
dismounting, or strike the victim with his long lance
while galloping side by side with it. If in this way he
can obtain two or three fat cows, before his horse becomes
<i>blown</i>, or the herd scatters beyond his reach, he
considers that he has had good success.</p>

<p class='c016'>But in this kind of chase the hunter is rarely alone:
the whole tribe takes part in it; and, mounted on their
well-trained mustangs, often pursue the buffalo gangs for
an hour or more, before the latter can get off and hide
themselves in the distance, or behind the swells of the
prairie. The clouds of dust raised in a <i>mêlée</i> of this
kind often afford the buffalo a chance of escaping,—especially
when they are running <i>with</i> the wind.</p>

<p class='c016'>A “buffalo surround” is effected by a large party
of hunters riding to a great distance; deploying themselves
into a circle around the herd; and then galloping
inward with loud yells. The buffaloes, thus attacked on
all sides, become frightened and confused, and are easily
driven into a close-packed mass, around the edges of
which the mounted hunters wheel and deliver their
arrows, or strike those that try to escape, with their long
spears. Sometimes the infuriated bulls rush upon the
horses, and gore them to death; and the hunters, thus
dismounted, often run a narrow risk of meeting with the
same fate,—more than a risk, for not unfrequently
they are killed outright. Often are they obliged to leap
up on the croup of a companion’s horse, to get out of
the way of danger; and many instances are recorded
where a horseman, by the stumbling of his horse, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>been pitched right into the thick of the herd, and has
made his escape by mounting on the backs of the bulls
themselves, and leaping from one to another until he has
reached clear ground again.</p>

<p class='c016'>The buffalo is never captured in a “pound,” as large
mammalia are in many countries. He is too powerful a
creature to be imprisoned by anything but the strongest
stockade fence; and for this the prairie country does
not afford materials. A contrivance, however, of a somewhat
similar character is occasionally resorted to by various
tribes of Indians. When it is known that the
buffaloes have become habituated to range in any part
of the country, where the plain is intersected by deep
ravines,—<i>cañons</i>, or <i>barrancas</i>, as they are called,—then
a grand <i>battue</i> is got up by driving the animals
pellmell over the precipitous bluffs, which universally
form the sides of these singular ravines. To guide the
herd to the point where it is intended they should take
the fatal leap, a singular contrivance is resorted to. This
consists in placing two rows of objects—which appear
to the buffalo to be human beings—in such a manner
that one end of each row abuts upon the edge of the
precipice, not very distant from the other, while the lines
extend far out into the plain, until they have diverged into
a wide and extensive funnel. It is simply the contrivance
used for guiding animals into a pound; but, instead of a
pair of close log fences, the objects forming these rows
stand at a considerable distance apart; and, as already
stated, appear to the not very discriminating eye of the
buffalo to be human beings. They are in reality designed
to resemble the human form in a rude fashion
and the material out of which they are constructed is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>neither more nor less than the dung of the buffaloes
themselves,—the <i>bois de vache</i>, as it is called by the
Canadian trappers, who often warm their shins, and
roast their buffalo ribs over a fire of this same material.</p>

<p class='c016'>The decoy being thus set, the mounted hunters next
make a wide sweep around the prairie,—including in
their deployment such gangs of buffaloes as may be
browsing between their line and the mouth of the funnel.
At first the buffaloes are merely guided forward,
or driven slowly and with caution,—as boys in snow-time
often drive larks toward their snares. When the
animals, however, have entered between the converging
lines of mock men, a rush, accompanied by hideous
yells, is made upon them from behind: the result of
which is, that they are impelled forward in a headlong
course towards the precipice.</p>

<p class='c016'>The buffalo is, at best, but a half-blind creature.
Through the long, shaggy locks hanging over his frontlet
he sees objects in a dubious light, or not at all. He
depends more on his scent than his sight; but though he
may scent a living enemy, the keenness of his organ
does not warn him of the yawning chasm that opens
before him,—not till it is too late to retire: for although
he may perceive the fearful leap before taking it, and
would willingly turn on his track, and refuse it, he finds
it no longer possible to do so. In fact, he is not allowed
time for reflection. The dense crowd presses from behind,
and he is left no choice, except that of springing
forward or suffering himself to be tumbled over upon
his head. In either case it is his last leap; and, frequently,
the last of a whole crowd of his companions.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>With such persecutions, I need hardly say that the
buffaloes are becoming scarcer every year; and it is
predicted that at no distant period this really valuable
mammal will be altogether extinct. At present their
range is greatly contracted within the wide boundaries
which it formerly occupied. Going west from the Mississippi,—at
any point below the mouth of the Missouri,—you
will not meet with buffalo for the first three
hundred miles; and, though the herds formerly ranged
to the south and west of the Rio Grande, the Comanches
on the banks of that river no longer know the buffalo,
except by their excursions to the grand prairie far to
the north of their country. The Great Slave Lake is
the northern terminus of the buffalo range; and westward
the chain of the Rocky Mountains; but of late
years stray herds have been observed at some points
west of these,—impelled through the passes by the
hunter-pressure of the horse-Indians from the eastward.
Speculators have adopted several ingenious and plausible
reasons to account for the diminution of the numbers
of the buffalo. There is but one cause worth assigning,—a
very simple one too,—the horse.</p>

<p class='c016'>With the disappearance of the buffalo,—or perhaps
with the thinning of their numbers,—the prairie Indians
may be induced to throw aside their roving habits.
This would be a happy result both for them and their
neighbors; though it is even doubtful whether it might
follow from such a circumstance. No doubt some change
would be effected in their mode of life; but unfortunately
these Bedouins of the Western world can live
upon the horse, even if the buffalo were entirely extirpated.
Even as it is, whole tribes of them subsist almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>exclusively upon horse-flesh, which they esteem and relish
more than any other food. But this resource would,
in time, also fail them; for they have not the economy
to raise a sufficient supply for the demand that would
occur were the buffaloes once out of the way: since the
<i>caballadas</i> of wild mustangs are by no means so easy
to capture as the “gangs” of unwieldy and lumbering
buffaloes.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is to be hoped, however, that before the horse-Indians
have been put to this trial, the strong arm of civilization
shall be extended over them, and, withholding
them from those predatory incursions, which they annually
make into the Mexican settlements, will induce
them to <i>dismount</i>, and turn peaceably to the tillage of
the soil,—now so successfully practised by numerous
tribes of their race, who dwell in fixed and flourishing
homes upon the eastern border of the prairies.</p>

<p class='c016'>At this moment, however, the Comanches are in open
hostility with the settlers of the Texan frontier. The
<i>lex talionis</i> is in active operation while we write, and
every mail brings the account of some sanguinary massacre,
or some act of terrible retaliation. The deeds
of blood and savage cruelty practised alike by both sides—whites
as well as Indians—have had their parallel,
it is true, but they are not the less revolting to read
about. The colonists have suffered much from these
Ishmaelites of the West,—these lordly savages, who regard
industry as a dishonorable calling; and who fancy
that their vast territory should remain an idle hunting-ground,
or rather a fortress, to which they might betake
themselves during their intervals of war and plundering.
The colonists have a clear title to the land,—that title
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>acknowledged by all right-thinking men, who believe
the good of the majority must not be sacrificed to the
obstinacy of the individual, or the minority,—that title
which gives the right to remove the dwelling of the
citizen,—his very castle,—rather than that the public
way be impeded. All admit this right; and just such a
title has the Texan colonist to the soil of the Comanche.
There may be guilt in the <i>mode</i> of establishing the
claim,—there may have been scenes of cruelty, and
blood unnecessarily spilt,—but it is some consolation
to know that there has occurred nothing yet to parallel
in cold-blooded atrocity the annals of Algiers, or the
similar acts committed in Southern Africa. The crime
of <i>smoke-murder</i> is yet peculiar to Pellisier and Potgieter.</p>

<p class='c016'>In their present outbreak, the Comanches have exhibited
but a poor, short-sighted policy. They will find
they have committed a grand error in mistaking the
courageous colonists of Texas for the weak Mexicans,—with
whom they have long been at war, and whom they
have almost invariably conquered. The result is easily
told: much blood may be shed on both sides, but it is
sure to end as all such contests do; and the Comanche,
like the Caffre, must “go to the wall.” Perhaps it is
better that things should be brought to a climax,—it
will certainly be better for the wretched remnant of the
Spano-Americans dwelling along the Comanche frontiers,—a
race who for a hundred years have not known
peace.</p>

<p class='c016'>As this long-standing hostility with the Mexican nation
has been a predominant feature in the history of
the Comanche Indian, it is necessary to give some account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of how it is usually carried on. There was a
time when the Spanish nation entertained the hope of
<i>Christianizing</i> these rude savages,—that is, taming and
training them to something of the condition to which
they have brought the Aztec descendants of Montezuma,—a
condition scarce differing from slavery itself. As
no gold or silver mines had been discovered in Texas, it
was not their intention to make mine-laborers of them;
but rather <i>peons</i>, or field-laborers, and tenders of cattle,—precisely
as they had done, and were still doing, with
the tribes of California. The soldier and the sword had
proved a failure,—as in many other parts of Spanish
America,—in fact, everywhere, except among the degenerated
remnants of monarchical misrule found in
Mexico, Bogota, and Peru. In these countries was
encountered the <i>débris</i> of a declining civilization, and
not, as is generally believed, the children of a progressive
development; and of course they gave way,—as
the people of all corrupted monarchies must in the end.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was different with the “Indios bravos,” or warrior
tribes, still free and independent,—the so-called <i>savages</i>.
Against these the soldier and the sword proved a complete
failure; and it therefore became necessary to use
the other kind of conquering power,—the monk and his
cross. Among the Comanches this kind of conquest had
attained a certain amount of success. Mission-houses
sprung up through the whole province of Texas,—the
Comanche country,—though the new neophytes were
not altogether Comanches, but rather Indians of other
tribes who were less warlike. Many Comanches, however,
became converts; and some of the “missiones”
became establishments on a grand scale,—each having,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>according to Spanish missionary-fashion, its “presidio,”
or garrison of troops, to keep the new believers within
sound of the bell, and to hunt and bring them back
whenever they endeavored to escape from that Christian
vassalage for which they had too rashly exchanged their
pagan freedom.</p>

<p class='c016'>All went well, so long as Spain was a power upon the
earth, and the Mexican viceroyalty was rich enough to
keep the presidios stocked with troopers. The monks
led as jolly a life as their prototypes of “Bolton Abbey
in the olden time.” The neophytes were simply their
slaves, receiving, in exchange for the sweat of their
brow, baptism, absolution, little pewter crucifixes, and
various like valuable commodities.</p>

<p class='c016'>But there came a time when they grew tired of the
exchange, and longed for their old life of roving freedom.
Their brethren had obtained the horse; and this
was an additional attraction which a prairie life presented.
They grew tired of the petty tricks of the
Christian superstition,—to their view less rational than
their own,—they grew tired of the toil of constant
work, the childlike chastisements inflicted, and sick of
the sound of that ever-clanging clapper,—the bell.
In fine, they made one desperate effort, and freed themselves
forever.</p>

<p class='c016'>The grand establishment of San Saba, on the river
of the same name, fell first. The troops were abroad
on some convert-hunting expedition. The Comanches
entered the fort,—their tomahawks and war-clubs hidden
under their great robes of buffalo-hide: the attack
commenced, and ended only with the annihilation of the
settlement.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>One monk alone escaped the slaughter,—a man renowned
for his holy zeal. He fled towards San Antonio,
pursued by a savage band. A large river coursed across
the route it was necessary for him to take; but this did
not intercept him: its waters opened for a moment, till
the bottom was bare from bank to bank. He crossed
without wetting his feet. The waves closed immediately
behind him, offering an impassable barrier to his pursuers,
who could only vent their fury in idle curses.
But the monk could curse too. He had, perhaps, taken
some lessons at the Vatican; and, turning round, he
anathematized every “mother’s son” of the red-skinned
savages. The wholesale excommunication produced a
wonderful effect. Every one of the accursed fell back
where he stood, and lay face upward upon the plain,
dead as a post! The monk, after baptizing the river
“Brazos de Dios” (arm of God), continued his flight,
and reached San Antonio in safety,—where he duly
detailed his miraculous adventure to the credulous converts
of Bejar, and the other missions.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such is the supposed origin of the name Brazos de
Dios, which the second river in Texas bears to this day.
It is to be remarked, however, that the river crossed by
the monk was the present Colorado, not the Brazos: for,
by a curious error of the colonists, the two rivers have
made an exchange of titles!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Comanches—freed from missionary rule, and
now equal to their adversaries by possession of the
horse—forthwith commenced their plundering expeditions;
and, with short intervals of truce,—periods <i>en
paz</i>,—have continued them to the present hour. All
Northern and Western Texas they soon recovered; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>they were not content with territory: they wanted horses
and cattle and chattels, and white wives and slaves; and
it would scarce be credited, were I to state the number
of these they have taken within the last half-century.
Nearly every year they have been in the habit of making
an expedition to the Mexican settlements of the provinces
Tamaulipas, New Leon, and Chihuahua,—every
expedition a fresh conquest over their feeble and corrupt
adversaries. On every occasion they have returned with
booty, consisting of horses, cattle, sheep, household utensils,
and, sad to relate, human captives. Women and
children only do they bring back,—the men they kill
upon sight. The children may be either male or female,—it
matters not which, as these are to be adopted into
their tribe, to become future warriors; and, strange to
relate, many of these, when grown up, not only refuse
to return to the land of their birth, but prove the most
bitter and dangerous foes to the people from whom they
have sprung! Even the girls and women, after a period,
become reconciled to their new home, and no longer desire
to leave it. Some, when afterwards discovered and
ransomed by their kindred, have refused to accept the
conditions, but prefer to continue the savage career into
which misfortune has introduced them! Many a heart-rending
scene has been the consequence of such apparently
unnatural predilections.</p>

<p class='c016'>You would wonder why such a state of things has
been so long submitted to by a civilized people; but it
is not so much to be wondered at. The selfishness that
springs from constant revolutions has destroyed almost
every sentiment of patriotism in the Mexican national
heart; and, indeed, many of these captives are perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>not much worse off under the guardianship of the brave
Comanches than they would have been, exposed to the
petty tyranny and robber-rule that has so long existed
in Mexico. Besides, it is doubtful whether the Mexican
government, with all her united strength, could retake
them. The Comanche country is as inaccessible to a
regular army as the territory of Timbuctoo; and it will
give even the powerful republic of the north no small
trouble to reduce these red freebooters to subjection.
Mexico had quite despaired of being able to make an
effort; and in the last treaty made between her and the
United States, one of the articles was a special agreement
on the part of the latter to restrain the Comanches
from future forays into the Mexican states, and also
cause them to deliver up the Mexican captives then in
the hands of the Indians!</p>

<p class='c016'>It was computed that their number at the time
amounted to four thousand! It is with regret I have
to add, that these unfortunates are still held in bondage.
The great republic, too busy with its own concerns, has
not carried out the stipulations of the treaty; and the
present Comanche war is but the result of this criminal
negligence. Had energetic measures been adopted at
the close of the Mexico-American war, the Comanche
would not now be harrying the settlers of Texas.</p>

<p class='c016'>To prove the incapacity of the Mexicans to deal with
this warlike race, it only needs to consider the present
condition of the northern Mexican states. One half
the territory in that extensive region has returned to the
condition of a desert. The isolated “ranchos” have
been long since abandoned,—the fields are overgrown
with weeds,—and the cattle have run wild, or been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>carried off by the Comanches. Only the stronger settlements
and large fortified haciendas any longer exist;
and many of these, too, have been deserted. Where
children once played in the security of innocence,—where
gayly-dressed cavaliers and elegant ladies amused
themselves in the pleasant <i>dia de campo</i>, such scenes are
no longer witnessed. The rancho is in ruins,—the door
hangs upon its hinge, broken and battered, or has been
torn off to feed the camp-fire of the savage; the dwelling
is empty and silent, except when the howling wolf or
coyote wakes up the echoes of its walls.</p>

<p class='c016'>About ten years ago, the proud governor of the state
of Chihuahua—one of the most energetic soldiers of
the Mexican republic—had a son taken captive by the
Comanches. Powerful though this man was, he knew it
was idle to appeal to arms; and was only too contented
to recover his child by paying a large ransom! This
fact, more than a volume of words, will illustrate the
condition of unhappy Mexico.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Comanche leads a gay, merry life,—he is far
from being the Indian of Cooper’s description. In scarcely
any respect does he resemble the sombre son of the
forest. He is lively, talkative, and ever ready for a
laugh. His butt is the Mexican presidio soldier, whom
he holds in too just contempt. He is rarely without a
meal. If the buffalo fails him, he can draw a steak
from his spare horses, of which he possesses a large
herd: besides, there are the wild mustangs, which he
can capture on occasions. He has no work to do except
war and hunting: at all other times he has slaves to
wait upon him, and perform the domestic drudgery.
When idle, he sometimes bestows great pains upon his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>dress,—which is the usual deer-skin tunic of the prairie
Indian, with moccasons and fringed leggings. Sometimes
a head-dress of plumes is worn; sometimes one of the
skin of the buffalo’s skull, with the horns left on! The
robe of buffalo pelt hangs from his shoulders, with all
the grandeur of a toga; but when he proceeds on a
plundering expedition, all these fripperies are thrown
aside, and his body appears naked from the waist to the
ears. Then only the breech-clout is worn, with leggings
and moccasons on his legs and feet. A coat of scarlet
paint takes the place of the hunting-shirt,—in order to
render his presence more terrific in the eyes of his
enemy. It needs not this. Without any disguise, the
sight of him is sufficiently horrifying,—sufficiently suggestive
of “blood and murder.”</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE PEHUENCHES, OR PAMPAS INDIANS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>The vast plain known as the “Pampas” is one of the
largest tracts of level country upon the face of the earth.
East and west it stretches from the mouth of the Rio de
la Plata to the foot-hills of the Andes mountains. It is
interrupted on the north by a series of mountains and
hill country, that cross from the Andes to the Paraguay
River, forming the Sierras of Mendoza, San Luis, and
Cordova; while its southern boundary is not so definitely
marked, though it may be regarded as ending at the
Rio Negro, where it meets, coming up from the south,
the desert plains of Patagonia.</p>

<p class='c016'>Geologically, the Pampas (or plains, as the word signifies,
in the language of the Peruvian Indians) is an alluvial
formation,—the bed of an ancient sea—upheaved
by some unknown cause to its present elevation, which is
not much above the ocean-level. It is not, therefore, a
<i>plateau</i> or “table-land,” but a vast natural meadow. The
soil is in general of a red color, argillaceous in character,
and at all points filled with marine shells and other testimonies
that the sea once rolled over it. It is in the
Pampas formation that many of the fossil monsters have
been found,—the gigantic <i>megatherium</i>, the colossal <i>mylodon</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and the giant armadillo (<i>glyptodon</i>), with many
other creatures, of such dimensions as to make it a subject
of speculation how the earth could have produced
food enough for their maintenance.</p>

<p class='c016'>In giving to the Pampas the designation of a <i>vast
meadow</i>, do not suffer yourself to be misled by this
phrase,—which is here and elsewhere used in rather a
loose and indefinite manner. Many large tracts in the
Pampas country would correspond well enough to this
definition,—both as regards their appearance and the
character of the herbage which covers them; but there
are other parts which bear not the slightest resemblance
to a meadow. There are vast tracts thickly
covered with tall thistles,—so tall as to reach to the
head of a man mounted on horseback, and so thickly
set, that neither man nor horse could enter them without
a path being first cleared for them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other extensive tracts are grown over with tall grass
so rank as to resemble reeds or rushes more than grass;
and an equally extensive surface is timbered with small
trees, standing thinly and without underwood, like the
fruit-trees in an orchard. Again, there are wide morasses
and extensive lakes, many of them brackish, and
some as salt as the sea itself. In addition to these,
there are “salinas,” or plains of salt,—the produce of
salt lakes, whose waters have evaporated, leaving a
stratum of pure salt often over a foot in thickness, and
covering their beds to an extent of many square leagues.
There are some parts, too, where the Pampas country
assumes a sterile and stony character,—corresponding
to that of the great desert of Patagonia. It is not correct,
therefore, to regard the Pampas as one unbroken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>tract of <i>meadow</i>. In one character alone is it uniform
in being a country without mountains,—or any considerable
elevations in the way of ridges or hills,—though a
few scattered sierras are found both on its northern and
southern edges.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Thistle Pampas</i>, as we take the liberty of naming
them, constitute perhaps the most curious section of this
great plain; and not the less so that the “weed” which
covers them is supposed not to be an indigenous production,
but to have been carried there by the early
colonists. About this, however, there is a difference of
opinion. No matter whence sprung, the thistles have
flourished luxuriantly, and at this day constitute a marked
feature in the scenery of the Pampas. Their position is
upon the eastern edge of the great plain, contiguous to the
banks of the La Plata; but from this river they extend
backwards into the interior, at some points to the distance
of nearly two hundred miles. Over this vast surface
they grow so thickly that, as already mentioned, it
is not possible for either man or horse to make way
through them. They can only be traversed by devious
paths—already formed by constant use, and leading
through narrow lanes or glades, where, for some reason,
the thistles do not choose to grow. Otherwise they
cannot be entered even by cattle. These will not, unless
compelled, attempt penetrating such an impervious
thicket; and if a herd driven along the paths should
chance to be “stampeded” by any object of terror, and
driven to take to the thistles, scarce a head of the whole
flock can ever afterwards be recovered. Even the instincts
of the dumb animals do not enable them to find
their way out again; and they usually perish, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>from thirst, or by the claws of the fierce pumas and
jaguars, which alone find themselves at home in the
labyrinthine “<i>cardonales</i>.” The little <i>viscacha</i> contrives
to make its burrow among them, and must find subsistence
by feeding upon their leaves and seed, since there
is no other herbage upon the ground,—the well-armed
thistle usurping the soil, and hindering the growth of
any other plants. It may be proper to remark, however,
that there are two kinds of these plants, both of
which cover large tracts of the plain. One is a true
thistle, while the other is a weed of the artichoke family,
called by the Spanish Americans “cardoon.” It is a
species of <i>Cardunculus</i>. The two do not mingle their
stalks, though both form thickets in a similar manner
and often in the same tract of country. The cardoon
is not so tall as the thistle; and, being without spines,
its “beds” are more easily penetrated; though even
among these, it would be easy enough to get entangled
and lost.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is proper to remark here, that these thistle-thickets
do not shut up the country all the year round. Only for
a season,—from the time they have grown up and
“shoot,” till their tall ripened stalks wither and fall back
to the earth, where they soon moulder into decay. The
plains are then open and free to all creatures,—man
among the rest,—and the Gaucho, with his herds of
horses, horned cattle, and sheep, or the troops of roving
Indians, spread over and take possession of them.</p>

<p class='c016'>The young thistles now present the appearance of a
vast field of turnips; and their leaves, still tender, are
greedily devoured by both cattle and sheep. In this
condition the Pampas thistles remain during their short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>winter; but as spring returns, they once more “bristle”
up, till, growing taller and stouter, they present a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>
that at length expels all intruders from
their domain.</p>

<p class='c016'>On the western selvage of this thistle tract lies the
grass-covered section of the Pampas. It is much more
extensive than that of the “cardonales,”—having an
average width of three hundred miles, and running
longitudinally throughout the whole northern and southern
extension of the Pampas. Its chief characteristic
is a covering of coarse grass,—which at different seasons
of the year is short or tall, green, brown, or yellowish,
according to the different degrees of ripeness.
When dry, it is sometimes fired,—either by design or
accident,—as are also the withered stems of the thistles;
and on these occasions a conflagration occurs, stupendous
in its effects,—often extending over vast tracts, and
reducing everything to black ashes. Nothing can be
more melancholy to the eye than the aspect of a burnt
pampa.</p>

<p class='c016'>The grass section is succeeded by that of the “openings,”
or scanty forests, already mentioned; but the
trees in many places are more closely set; assuming
the character of thickets, or “jungles.” These tracts
end among the spurs of the Andes,—which, at some
points, are thrown out into the plain, but generally rise
up from it abruptly and by a well-defined border.</p>

<p class='c016'>The marshes and bitter lakes above mentioned are
the produce of numerous streams, which have their rise
in the Great Cordillera of the Andes, and run eastward
across the Pampas. A few of these, that trend in a
southerly direction, reach the Atlantic by means of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>two great outlets,—the “Colorado” and “Negro.” All
the others—and “their name is legion”—empty their
waters into the morasses and lakes, or sink into the soil
of the plains, at a greater or less distance from the Cordillera,
according to the body of water they may carry
down. Evaporation keeps up the equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c016'>Who are the dwellers upon the Pampas? To whom
does this vast pasture-ground belong? Whose flocks
and herds are they that browse upon it?</p>

<p class='c016'>You will be told that the Pampas belong to the republic
of Buenos Ayres, or rather to the “States of the
Argentine Confederation,”—that they are inhabited by
a class of citizens called “Gauchos,” who are of Spanish
race, and whose sole occupation is that of herdsmen,
breeders of cattle and horses,—men famed for their
skill as horsemen, and for their dexterity in the use of
the “lazo” and “bolas,”—two weapons borrowed from
the aboriginal races.</p>

<p class='c016'>All this is but partially true. The proprietorship of
this great plain was never actually in the hands of the
Buenos-Ayrean government, nor in those of their predecessors,—the
Spaniards. Neither has ever owned it—either
by conquest or otherwise—no further than by
an empty boast of ownership; for, from the day when
they first set foot upon its borders to the present hour,
neither has ever been able to cross it, or penetrate any
great distance into it, without a grand army to back
their progress. But their possession virtually ceased at
the termination of each melancholy excursion; and the
land relapsed to its original owners. With the exception
of some scanty strips along its borders, and some wider
ranges, thinly occupied by the half-nomade Gauchos, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Pampas are in reality an Indian territory, as they have
always been; and the claim of the white man is no
more than nominal,—a mere title upon the map. It is
not the only vast expanse of Spanish-American soil that
<i>never was Spanish</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The true owners of the Pampas, then, are the red
aborigines,—the Pampas Indians; and to give some
account of these is now our purpose.</p>

<p class='c016'>Forming so large an extent, it is not likely it should
all belong to one united tribe,—that would at once
elevate them into the character of a nation. But they
are not united. On the contrary, they form several
distinct associations, with an endless number of smaller
subdivisions or communities,—just in the same way as
it is among their prairie cousins of the north. They
may all, however, be referred to four grand tribal associations
or nationalities,—the <i>Pehuenches</i>, <i>Puelches</i>,
<i>Picunches</i>, and <i>Ranqueles</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some add the <i>Puilliches</i>, who dwell on the southern
rim of the Pampas; but these, although they extend
their excursions over a portion of the great plain, are
different from the other Pampas Indians in many respects,—altogether
a braver and better race of men,
and partaking more of the character of the Patagonians,—both
in point of <i>physique</i> and <i>morale</i>,—of
which tribes, indeed, they are evidently only a branch,
In their dealings with white men, when fairly treated,
these have exhibited the same noble bearing which characterizes
the true Patagonian. I shall not, therefore,
lower the standard—neither of their bodies nor their
minds—by classing them among “Pampas Indians.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Of these tribes—one and all of them—we have,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>unfortunately, a much less favorable impression; and
shall therefore be able to say but little to their credit.</p>

<p class='c016'>The different names are all native. <i>Puelches</i> means
the people living to the east, from “<i>puel</i>,” east, and
<i>che</i>, people. The <i>Picunches</i> derive this appellation, in a
similar fashion, from “<i>picun</i>,” signifying the north. The
<i>Pehuenches</i> are the people of the pine-tree country, from
“<i>pehuen</i>,” the name for the celebrated “Chili pine”
(<i>Araucaria</i>); and the <i>Ranqueles</i> are the men who dwell
among the thistles, from <i>ranquel</i>, a thistle.</p>

<p class='c016'>These national appellations will give some idea of the
locality which each tribe inhabits. The <i>Ranqueles</i> dwell,
not among the thistles,—for that would be an unpleasant
residence, even to a red-skin; but along the western
border of this tract. To the westward of them, and up
into the clefts of the Cordilleras extends the country of
the Pehuenches; and northward of both lies the land of
the Picunches. Their boundary in that direction <i>should
be</i> the frontiers of the <i>quasi-civilized</i> provinces of San
Luis and Cordova, but they are not; for the Picunche
can at will extend his plundering forays as far north as
he pleases: even to <i>dovetailing</i> them into the similar
excursions of his <i>Guaycuru</i> kinsmen from the “Gran
Chaco” on the north.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Puelche territory is on the eastern side of the
Pampas, and south from Buenos Ayres. At one time
these people occupied the country to the banks of the
La Plata; and no doubt it was they who first met the
Spaniards in hostile array. Even up to a late period
their forays extended almost to Buenos Ayres itself; but
Rosas, tyrant as he may have been, was nevertheless a
true soldier, and in a grand military expedition against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>them swept their country, and inflicted such a terrible
chastisement upon both them and the neighboring tribes,
as they had not suffered since the days of Mendoza.
The result has been a retirement of the Puelche frontier
to a much greater distance from Buenos Ayres; but
how long it may continue stationary is a question,—no
longer than some strong arm—such as that of Rosas—is
held threateningly over them.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is usual to inquire whence come a people; and the
question has been asked of the Pampas Indians. It is
not difficult to answer. They came from the land of
Arauco. Yes, they are the kindred of that famed people
whom the Spaniards could never subdue,—even
with all their strength put forth in the effort. They are
near kindred too,—the Pehuenches especially,—whose
country is only separated from that of the Araucanians
by the great Cordillera of Chili; and with whom, as well
as the Spaniards on the Chilian side, they have constant
and friendly intercourse.</p>

<p class='c016'>But it must be admitted, that the Araucanians have
had far more than their just meed of praise. The romantic
stories, in that endless epic of the rhymer Ercilla,
have crept into history; and the credulous Molina has
endorsed them: so that the true character of the Araucanian
Indian has never been understood. Brave he has
shown himself, beyond doubt, in defending his country
against Spanish aggression; but so, too, has the Carib
and Guaraon,—so, too, has the Comanche and Apache,
the Yaqui of Sonora, the savage of the Mosquito shore,
the Guaycuru of the Gran Chaco, and a score of other
Indian tribes,—in whose territory the Spaniard has
never dared to fix a settlement. Brave is the Araucanian;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>but, beyond this, he has few virtues indeed.
He is cruel in the extreme,—uncivil and selfish,—filthy
and indolent,—a polygamist in the most approved
fashion,—a very tyrant over his own,—in short, taking
rank among the beastliest of semi-civilized savages,—for
it may be here observed, that he is not exactly
what is termed a <i>savage</i>: that is, he does not go naked,
and sleep in the open air. On the contrary, he clothes
himself in stuff of his own weaving,—or rather, that of
his slave-wives,—and lives in a hut which they build
for him. He owns land, too,—beautiful fields,—of
which he makes no use: except to browse a few horses,
and sheep, and cattle. For the rest, he is too indolent
to pursue agriculture; and spends most of his time in
drinking <i>chicha</i>, or tyrannizing over his wives. This
is the heroic Araucanian who inhabits the plains and
valleys of Southern Chili.</p>

<p class='c016'>Unfortunately, by passing to the other side of the
Andes, he has not improved his manners. The air of
the Pampas does not appear to be conducive to virtue;
and upon that side of the mountains it can scarce be
said to exist,—even in the shape of personal courage.
The men of the pines and thistles seem to have lost this
quality, while passing through the snows of the Cordilleras,
or left it behind them, as they have also left the
incipient civilization of their race. On the Pampas we
find them once more in the character of the true savage:
living by the chase or by plunder; and bartering the
produce of the latter for the trappings and trinkets of
personal adornment, supplied them by the unprincipled
white trader. Puelches and Picunches, Pehuenches
and Ranqueles, all share this character alike,—all are
treacherous, quarrelsome, and cowardly.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>But we shall now speak more particularly of their
customs and modes of life, and we may take the “pine
people” as our text,—since these are supposed to be
most nearly related to the true Araucanians,—and, indeed,
many of their “ways” are exactly the same as
those of that “heroic nation.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The “people of the pines” are of the ordinary stature
of North-American Indians, or of Europeans; and their
natural color is a dark coppery hue. But it is not often
you can see them in their natural color: for the Pampas
Indians, like nearly all the aboriginal tribes, are “painters.”
They have pigments of black and white, blue,
red, and yellow,—all of which they obtain from different
colored stones, found in the streams of the Cordilleras.
“Yama,” they call the black stone; “colo,” the
red; “palan,” the white; and “codin,” the blue; the
yellow they obtain from a sort of argillaceous earth.
The stones of each color they submit to a rubbing or
grinding process, until a quantity of dust is produced;
which, being mixed with suet, constitutes the paint,
ready for being laid on.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Pampas Indians do not confine themselves to
any particular “escutcheon.” In this respect their fancy
is allowed a wide scope, and their fashions change. A
face quite black, or red, is a common countenance
among them; and often may be seen a single band,
of about two inches in width, extending from ear to ear
across the eyes and nose. On war excursions they paint
hideous figures: not only on their own faces and bodies,
but on their trappings, and even upon the bodies of their
horses,—aiming to render themselves as appalling as
possible in the sight of their enemies. The same trick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>is employed by the warriors of the prairies, as well as
in many other parts of the world. Under ordinary
circumstances, the Pampas Indian is not a <i>naked</i> savage.
On the contrary, he is well clad; and, so far from obtaining
the material of his garments from the looms of
civilized nations, he weaves it for himself,—that is, his
wives weave it; and in such quantity that he has not
only enough for his own “wear,” but more than enough,
a surplus for trade. The cloth is usually a stuff spun
and woven from sheep’s wool. It is coarse, but durable;
and in the shape of blankets or “ponchos,” is eagerly
purchased by the Spanish traders. Silver spurs, long,
pointed knives, lance-heads, and a few other iron commodities,
constitute the articles of exchange, with various
ornamental articles, as beads, rings, bracelets, and large-headed
silver bodkins to fasten their cloaks around the
shoulders of his “ladies.” Nor is he contented with
mere tinsel, as other savages are,—he can tell the
difference between the real metal and the counterfeit, as
well as the most expert assayer; and if he should fancy
to have a pair of silver spurs, not even a Jew pedler
could put off upon him the plated “article.” In this
respect the Araucanian Indian has been distinguished,
since his earliest intercourse with Europeans; and his
Pampas kindred are equally subtle in their appreciation.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Pampas Indian, when well dressed, has a cloak
upon his shoulders of the thick woollen stuff already
described. It is usually woven in colors; and is not
unlike the “poncho” worn by the “gauchos” of Buenos
Ayres, or the “serape” of the Mexicans. Besides the
cloak, his dress consists of a mere skirt,—also of colored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>woollen stuff, being an oblong piece swathed around his
loins, and reaching to the knee. A sash or belt—sometimes
elaborately ornamented—binds the cloth around
the waist. Boots of a peculiar construction complete
the costume. These are manufactured in a very simple
manner. The fresh skin taken from a horse’s hind leg
is drawn on—just as if it were a stocking—until the
heel rests in that part which covered the hock-joint of
the original wearer. The superfluous portion is then
trimmed to accommodate itself as a covering for the
foot; and the boot is not only finished, but put on,—there
to remain until it is worn out, and a new one
required! If it should be a little loose at first, that does
not matter. The hot sun, combined with the warmth
of the wearer’s leg, soon contracts the hide, and brings it
to “fit like a glove.” The head is often left uncovered;
but as often a sort of skull-cap or helmet of horse-skin is
worn; and not unfrequently a high, conical hat of palm-fibre.
This last is not a native production, but an importation
of the traders. So also is a pair of enormous
rings of brass, which are worn in the ears; and are as
bulky as a pair of padlocks. In this costume, mounted
on horseback with his long lance in hand, the Pampas
Indian would be a picturesque object; and really is so,
when <i>clean</i>; but that is only on the very rarest occasions,—only
when he has donned a new suit. At all
other times, not only his face and the skin of his body,
but every rag upon his back, are covered with grease
and filth,—so as to produce an effect rather “tatterdemalion”
than picturesque.</p>

<p class='c016'>The “squaw” is costumed somewhat differently.
First she has a long “robe,” which covers her from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>neck to heels, leaving only her neck and arms bare.
The robe is of red or blue woollen stuff of her own
weaving. This garment is the “quedeto.” A belt,
embroidered with beads, called “quepique,” holds it
around the waist, by means of a large silver buckle.
This belt is an article of first fashion. Over the shoulders
hangs the “iquilla,” which is a square piece of
similar stuff,—but usually of a different dye; and
which is fastened in front by a pin with a large silver
head, called the “tupo.” The shock of thick, black hair—after
having received the usual anointment of mare’s
tallow, the fashionable hair-oil of the Pampas Indians—is
kept in its place by a sort of cap or <i>coiffure</i>, like
a shallow dish inverted, and bristling all over with
trader’s beads. To this a little bell is fastened; or
sometimes a brace of them are worn as ear-rings. These
tinkle so agreeably in the ears of the wearer, that she
can scarce for a moment hold her head at rest, but
keeps rocking it from side to side, as a Spanish coquette
would play with her fan.</p>

<p class='c016'>In addition to this varied wardrobe, the Pampas belle
carries a large stock of bijouterie,—such as beads and
bangles upon her neck, rings and circlets upon her arms,
ankles, and fingers; and, to set her snaky locks in order,
she separates them by means of a stiff brush, made from
the fibrous roots of a reed. <i>She</i> is <i>picturesque</i> enough,
but never <i>pretty</i>. Nature has given the Araucanian
woman a plain face; and all the adornment in the world
cannot hide its homeliness.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Pehuenche builds no house. He is a true nomade,
and dwells in a tent, though one of the rudest
construction. As it differs entirely from the tent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the prairie Indians, it may be worth while describing
it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Its framework is of reeds,—of the same kind as
are used for the long lances so often mentioned; and
which resemble <i>bambusa</i> canes. They grow in plenty
throughout the Pampas, especially near the mountains,—where
they form impenetrable thickets on the borders
of the marshy lakes. Any other flexible poles will
serve as well, when the canes are not “handy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The poles being procured, one is first bent into a
semicircle, and in this shape both ends are stuck into
the ground, so as to form an arch about three feet in
height. This arch afterwards becomes the doorway or
entrance to the tent. The remaining poles are attached
to this first one at one end, and at right angles; and
being carried backward with a slight bend, their other
ends are inserted into the turf. This forms the skeleton
of the tent; and its covering is a horse-skin, or rather
a number of horse-skins stitched together, making a
sort of large tarpaulin. The skins are sewed with the
sinews of the horse or ox,—which are first chewed by
the women, until their fibres become separated like
hemp, and are afterwards spun by them into twine.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tent is not tall enough to admit of a man standing
erect; and in it the Pehuenche crouches, whenever
it snows, rains, or blows cold. He has sheep-skins spread
to sleep upon, and other skins to serve as bed-clothes,—all
in so filthy a condition, that but for the cold, he might
find it far more comfortable to sleep in the open air. He
never attempts to sweep out this miserable lair; but
when the spot becomes <i>very</i> filthy, he “takes up his
sticks” and shifts his <i>penates</i> to a fresh “location.” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>is generally, however, too indolent to make a “remove,”—until
the dirt has accumulated so as to “be in the
way.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Pampas Indian is less of a hunter than most
other tribes of savages. He has less need to be,—at
least, in modern days; for he is in possession of three
kinds of valuable domestic animals, upon which he can
subsist without hunting,—horses, horned cattle, and
sheep. Of course, these are of colonial origin. He
hunts, nevertheless, for amusement, and to vary his food.
The larger ostrich (<i>rhea Americana</i>), the guanaco, and
the great “gama” stag of the Pampas (<i>cervus campestris</i>)
are his usual game. These he captures with the
<i>bolas</i>,—which is his chief implement for the chase. In
the flesh of the stag he may find a variety, but not a
delicacy. Its venison would scarce tempt a Lucullian
palate,—since even the hungriest Gaucho will not eat
it. It is a large beast, often weighing above three hundred
pounds; and infecting the air with such a rank
odor, that dogs decline to follow it in the chase. This
odor is generated in a pair of glands situated near the
eyes; and it has the power of projecting it at will,—just
as skunks and polecats when closely chased by an enemy.
If these glands are cut out immediately after the
animal is killed, the flesh tastes well enough: otherwise
it is too rank to be eatable. The Indians cure it of
the “bad smell” by burying it for several days in the
ground; which has the effect of “sweetening” it, while
at the same time it makes it more tender.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the Pampas Indian does not rely upon the chase
for his subsistence. He is a small grazier in his way
and is usually accompanied in his wanderings by a herd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>of horned cattle and sheep. He has also his stud of
horses; which furnish the <i>staple</i> of his food,—for whenever
he hungers, a horse is “slaughtered.” Strictly
speaking, it is not a horse; for it is the mare that is used
for this purpose. In no part of the Pampas region,—not
even in the white settlement,—are the mares used
for riding. It would be considered derogatory to the
character of either Gaucho or Indian to mount a mare;
and these are kept only for breeding purposes. Not
that the Indian is much of a horse-breeder. He keeps
up his stock in quite another way,—by stealing. The
same remark will apply to the mode by which he recruits
his herds of horned cattle, and his flocks of sheep. The
last he values only for their wool; out of which his garments
are woven; and which has replaced the scantier
fleece of the vicuña and guanaco,—the material used
by him in days gone by.</p>

<p class='c016'>From whom does he steal these valuable animals,—and
in such numbers as almost to subsist upon them?
That is a question that can be easily answered; though
it is not exact language to say that he steals them.
Rather say that he <i>takes</i> them, by main force and in
open daylight,—takes them from the Creole Spaniard,—the
Gaucho and <i>estanciero</i>. Nay, he does not content
himself always with four-footed plunder; but often
returns from his forays with a crowd of captives,—women
and children, with white skins and ruddy cheeks,—afterwards
to be converted into his drudges and slaves.
Not alone to the frontier does he extend these plundering
expeditions; but even into the heart of the Spanish settlements,—to
the estancias of grandees, and the gates
of fortified towns; and, strange as it may read, this condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>of things has been in existence, not for years, but,
at intervals, extending over a century!</p>

<p class='c016'>But what may read stranger still—and I can vouch
for it as true—is, that <i>white men</i> actually purchase this
plunder from him,—not the human part of it, but the
four-footed and the <i>furniture</i>,—for this, too, sometimes
forms part of his booty. Yes, the surplus, of which the
Indian can make no use or cares nothing about,—more
especially the large droves of fine horses, taken from
the Spaniards of Buenos Ayres,—are driven through
the passes of the Cordilleras, and sold to the Spaniards
of Chili! the people of one province actually encouraging
the robbery of their kindred race in another!
The very same condition of things exists in North
America. The Comanche steals, or rather takes, from
the white settler of Tamaulipas and New Leon,—the
Apache rieves from the white settler of Chihuahua and
Sonora: both sell to the white settlers, who dwell along
the banks of the Rio del Norte! And all these settlers
are of one race,—one country,—one kindred! These
things have hitherto been styled <i>cosas de Mexico</i>. Their
signification may be extended to South America: since
they are equally <i>cosas de las Pampas</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>We are not permitted to doubt the truth of these appalling
facts,—neither as regards the nefarious traffic,
nor the captive women and children. At this very hour,
not less than four thousand individuals of Spanish-Mexican
race are held captives by the prairie tribes; and
when Rosas swept the Pampas, he released fifteen hundred
of similar unfortunates from their worse than Egyptian
taskmasters,—the Puelches!</p>

<p class='c016'>With such facts as these before our eyes, who can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>doubt the decline of the Spanish power? the utter enfeeblement
of that once noble race? Who can contradict
the hypothetical prophecy—more than once offered
in these pages—that if the two races be left to themselves,
the aboriginal, before the lapse of a single century,
will once more recover the soil; and his haughty
victor be swept from the face of the American continent?</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor need such a change be too keenly regretted. The
Spanish occupation of America has been an utter failure.
It has served no high human purpose, but the contrary.
It has only corrupted and encowardiced a once brave
and noble race; and, savage as may be the character of
that which would supplant it, still that savage has within
him the elements of a future civilization.</p>

<p class='c016'>Not so the Spaniard. The fire of his civilization has
blared up with a high but fitful gleam. It has passed
like the lightning’s flash. Its sparks have fallen and
died out,—never to be rekindled again.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE YAMPARICOS, OR ROOT-DIGGERS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>It is now pretty generally known that there are many
<i>deserts</i> in North America,—as wild, waste, and inhospitable
as the famed Sahara of Africa. These deserts occupy
a large portion of the central regions of that great
continent—extending, north and south, from Mexico to
the shores of the Arctic Sea; and east and west for several
hundred miles, on each side of the great vertebral
chain of the Rocky Mountains. It is true that in the
vast territory thus indicated, the desert is not continuous;
but it is equally true that the fertile stripes or
valleys that intersect it, bear but a very small proportion
to the whole surface. Many tracts are there, of
larger area than all the British Islands, where the desert
is scarce varied by an oasis, and where the very rivers
pursue their course amidst rocks and barren sands, without
a blade of vegetation on their banks. Usually, however,
a narrow selvage of green—caused by the growth
of cottonwoods, willows, and a few humbler plants—denotes
the course of a stream,—a glad sight at all times
to the weary and thirsting traveller.</p>

<p class='c016'>These desert wastes are not all alike, but differ much
in character. In one point only do they agree,—they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>are all <i>deserts</i>. Otherwise they exhibit many varieties,—both
of aspect and nature. Some of them are level
plains, with scarce a hill to break the monotony of the
view: and of this character is the greater portion of the
desert country extending eastward from the Rocky
Mountains to about 100° of west longitude. At this
point the soil gradually becomes more fertile,—assuming
the character of timbered tracts, with prairie opening
between,—at length terminating in the vast, unbroken
forests of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c016'>This eastern desert extends parallel with the Rocky
Mountains,—throughout nearly the whole of their length,—from
the Rio Grande in Mexico, northward to the
Mackenzie River. One tract of it deserves particular
mention. It is that known as the <i>Llano estacado</i>, or
“staked plain.” It lies in Northwestern Texas, and consists
of a barren plateau, of several thousand square miles
in extent, the surface of which is raised nearly a thousand
feet above the level of the surrounding plains.
Geologists have endeavored to account for this singular
formation, but in vain. The table-like elevation of the
Llano estacado still remains a puzzle. Its name, however,
is easier of explanation. In the days of Spanish
supremacy over this part of Prairie-land, caravans frequently
journeyed from Santa Fé in New Mexico, to
San Antonio in Texas. The most direct route between
these two provincial capitals lay across the Llano estacado;
but as there were neither mountains nor other
landmarks to guide the traveller, he often wandered
from the right path,—a mistake that frequently ended
in the most terrible suffering from thirst, and very often
in the loss of life. To prevent such catastrophes, <i>stakes</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>were set up at such intervals as to be seen from one
another, like so many “telegraph posts;” and although
these have long since disappeared, the great plain still
bears the name, given to it from this circumstance.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides the contour of surface, there are other respects
in which the desert tracts of North America differ from
one another. In their vegetation—if it deserves the
name—they are unlike. Some have no vegetation
whatever; but exhibit a surface of pure sand, or sand
and pebbles; others are covered with a stratum of soda,
of snow-white color, and still others with a layer of common
salt, equally white and pure. Many of these salt
and soda “prairies”—as the trappers term them—are
hundreds of square miles in extent. Again, there are
deserts of scoria, of lava, and pumice-stone,—the “cut-rock
prairies” of the trappers,—a perfect contrast in
color to the above mentioned. All these are absolutely
without vegetation of any sort.</p>

<p class='c016'>On some of the wastes—those of southern latitudes,—the
cactus appears of several species, and also the
wild agave, or “pita” plant; but these plants are in
reality but emblems of the desert itself. So, also, is
the <i>yucca</i>, which thinly stands over many of the great
plains, in the southwestern part of the desert region,—its
stiff, shaggy foliage in no way relieving the sterile
landscape, but rather rendering its aspect more horrid
and austere.</p>

<p class='c016'>Again, there are the deserts known as “chapparals,”—extensive
jungles of brush and low trees, all of a
thorny character, among which the “mezquite” of several
species (<i>mimosas</i> and <i>acacias</i>), the “stink-wood”
or creosote plant (<i>kœberlinia</i>), the “grease-bush” (<i>obiona canescens</i>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>several kinds of <i>prosopis</i>, and now and then,
as if to gratify the eye of the tired traveller, the tall
flowering spike of the scarlet <i>fouquiera</i>. Further to
the north—especially throughout the upper section of
the Great Salt Lake territory—are vast tracts, upon
which scarce any vegetation appears, except the <i>artemisia</i>
plant, and other kindred products of a sterile soil.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of all the desert tracts upon the North-American
continent, perhaps none possesses greater interest for
the student of cosmography than that known as the
“Great Basin.” It has been so styled from the fact
of its possessing a hydrographic system of its own,—lakes
and rivers that have no communication with the
sea; but whose waters spend themselves within the
limits of the desert itself, and are kept in equilibrium
by evaporation,—as is the case with many water systems
of the continents of the Old World, both in Asia
and Africa.</p>

<p class='c016'>The largest lake of the “Basin” is the “Great Salt
Lake,”—of late so celebrated in Mormon story: since
near its southern shore the chief city of the “Latter-day
Saints” is situated. But there are other large lakes
within the limits of the Great Basin, both fresh and
saline,—most of them entirely unconnected with the
Great Salt Lake, and some of them having a complete
system of waters of their own. There are “Utah”
and “Humboldt,” “Walker’s” and “Pyramid” lakes,
with a long list of others, whose names have been but
recently entered upon the map, by the numerous very
intelligent explorers employed by the government of the
United States.</p>

<p class='c016'>Large rivers, too, run in all directions through this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>central desert, some of them falling into the Great
Salt Lake, as the “Bear” river, the “Weber,” the
“Utah,” from Utah Lake,—upon which the Mormon
metropolis stands,—and which stream has been absurdly
baptized by these free-living fanatics as the
“Jordan!” Other rivers are the “Timpanogos,” emptying
into Lake Utah; the “Humboldt,” that runs to
the lake of that name; the “Carson” river; besides
many of lesser note.</p>

<p class='c016'>The limits assigned to the Great Basin are tolerably
well defined. Its western rim is the <i>Sierra Nevada</i>, or
“snowy range” of California; while the Rocky and
Wahsatch mountains are its boundaries on the east.
Several cross-ranges, and spurs of ranges, separate it
from the system of waters that empty northward into
the Columbia River of Oregon; while upon its southern
edge there is a more indefinite “divide” between it
and the great desert region of the western “Colorado.”
Strictly speaking, the desert of the Great Basin might
be regarded as only a portion of that vast tract of sterile,
and almost treeless soil, which stretches from the Mexican
state of Sonora to the upper waters of Oregon; but
the deserts of the Colorado on the south, and those of
the “forks” of the Columbia on the north, are generally
treated as distinct territories; and the Great Basin, with
the limits already assigned, is suffered to stand by
itself. As a separate country, then, we shall here consider
it.</p>

<p class='c016'>From its name, you might fancy that the Great Basin
was a low-lying tract of country. This, however, is
far from being the case. On the contrary, nearly all of
it is of the nature of an elevated table-land, even its lakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>lying several thousand feet above the level of the sea.
It is only by its “rim,” of still more elevated mountain
ridges, that it can lay claim to be considered as a
“basin;” but, indeed, the name—given by the somewhat
speculative explorer, Fremont—is not very appropriate,
since later investigations show that this rim
is in many places neither definite nor regular,—especially
on its northern and southern sides, where the
“Great Basin” may be said to be badly cracked, and
even to have some pieces chipped out of its edge.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides the mountain chains that surround it, many
others run into and intersect it in all directions. Some
are spurs of the main ranges; while others form “sierras”—as
the Spaniards term them—distinct in themselves.
These sierras are of all shapes and of every
altitude,—from the low-lying ridge scarce rising above
the plain, to peaks and summits of over ten thousand
feet in elevation. Their forms are as varied as their
height. Some are round or dome-shaped; others shoot
up little turrets or “needles”; and still others mount
into the sky in shapeless masses,—as if they had been
flung upon the earth, and upon one another, in some
struggle of Titans, who have left them lying in chaotic
confusion. A very singular mountain form is hero
observed,—though it is not peculiar to this region
since it is found elsewhere, beyond the limits of the
Great Basin, and is also common in many parts of
Africa. This is the formation known among the Spaniards
as <i>mesas</i>, or “table-mountains,” and by this very
name it is distinguished among the colonists of the
Cape.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>Llano estacado</i>, already mentioned, is often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>styled a “mesa,” but its elevation is inconsiderable
when compared with the <i>mesa</i> mountains that occur in
the regions west of the great Rocky chain,—both in
the Basin and on the deserts of the Colorado. Many
of these are of great height,—rising several thousand
feet above the general level; and, with their square
truncated <i>table-like</i> tops, lend a peculiar character to
the landscape.</p>

<p class='c016'>The characteristic vegetation of the Great Basin is
very similar to that of the other central regions of the
North-American continent. Only near the banks of the
rivers and some of the fresh-water lakes, is there any
evidence of a fertile soil; and even in these situations
the timber is usually scarce and stunted. Of course,
there are tracts that are exceptional,—oases, as they
are geographically styled. Of this character is the
country of the Mormons on the Jordan, their settlements
on the Utah and Bear Rivers, in Tuilla and Ogden
valleys, and elsewhere at more remote points. There
are also isolated tracts on the banks of the smaller
streams and the shores of lakes not yet “located” by
the colonist; and only frequented by the original dwellers
of the desert, the red aborigines. In these oases
are usually found cottonwood-trees, of several distinct
species,—one or other of which is the characteristic
vegetation on nearly every stream from the Mississippi
to the mountains of California.</p>

<p class='c016'>Willows of many species also appear; and now and
then, in stunted forms, the oak, the elm, maples, and
sycamores. But all these last are very rarely encountered
within the limits of the desert region. On the
mountain, and more frequently in the mountain ravines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>pines of many species—some of which produce edible
cones—grow in such numbers as to merit the name of
forests, of greater or less extent. Among these, or apart
from them, may be distinguished the darker foliage of
the cedar (<i>juniperus</i>) of several varieties, distinct from
the <i>juniperus virginiana</i> of the States.</p>

<p class='c016'>The arid plains are generally without the semblance
of vegetation. When any appears upon them, it is of
the character of the “chapparal,” already described; its
principal growth being “tornilla,” or “screw-wood,” and
other varieties of <i>mezquite</i>; all of them species of the
extensive order of the <i>leguminosæ</i>, and belonging to the
several genera of <i>acacias</i>, <i>mimosas</i>, and <i>robinias</i>. In
many places <i>cactacæ</i> appear of an endless variety of
forms; and some,—as the “pitahaya” (<i>cereus giganteus</i>),
and the “tree” and “cochineal” cacti (<i>opuntias</i>),—of
gigantesque proportions. These, however, are only developed
to their full size in the regions further south,—on
the deserts of the Colorado and Gila,—where also
the “tree yuccas” abound, covering tracts of large
extent, and presenting the appearance of forests of
palms.</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps the most characteristic vegetation of the
Great Basin—that is, if it deserve the name of a
vegetation—is the wild sage, or <i>artemisia</i>. With this
plant vast plains are covered, as far as the eye can reach;
not presenting a hue of green, as the grass prairies do,
but a uniform aspect of grayish white, as monotonous as
if the earth were without a leaf to cover it. Instead of
relieving the eye of the traveller, the artemisia rather
adds to the dreariness of a desert landscape,—for its
presence promises food neither to man nor horse, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>water for them to drink, but indicates the absence of
both. Upon the hill-sides also is it seen, along the
sloping declivities of the sierras, marbling the dark
volcanic rocks with its hoary frondage.</p>

<p class='c016'>More than one species of this wild sage occurs throughout
the American desert: there are four or five kinds, differing
very considerably from each other, and known to the
trappers by such names as “worm wood,” “grease-bush,”
“stink-plant,” and “rabbit-bush.” Some of the species
attain to a considerable height,—their tops often rising
above the head of the traveller on horseback,—while
another kind scarce reaches the knee of the pedestrian.</p>

<p class='c016'>In some places the plains are so thickly covered with
this vegetation, that it is difficult for either man or horse
to make way through them,—the gnarled and crooked
branches twisting into each other and forming an impenetrable
wattle. At other places, and especially where
the larger species grow, the plants stand apart like apple-trees
in an orchard, and bear a considerable resemblance
to shrubs or small trees.</p>

<p class='c016'>Both man and horse refuse the artemisia as food; and
so, too, the less fastidious mule. Even a donkey will
not eat it. There are animals, however,—both birds
and beasts, as will be seen hereafter,—that relish the
sage-plant; and not only eat of it, but subsist almost
exclusively on its stalks, leaves, and berries.</p>

<p class='c016'>The denizens of the Great Basin desert—I mean its
human denizens—are comprehended in two great families
of the aboriginal race,—the <i>Utahs</i> and <i>Snakes</i>, or
<i>Shoshonees</i>. Of the white inhabitants—the Mormons
and trap-settlers—we have nothing to say here. Nor
yet much respecting the above-mentioned Indians, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Utahs and Snakes. It will be enough for our purpose
to make known that these two tribes are distinct
from each other,—that there are many communities or
sub-tribes of both,—that each claims ownership of a
large tract of the central region, lying between the
Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada; and that
their limits are not coterminal with those of the Great
Basin: since the range of the Snakes extends into Oregon
upon the north, while that of the Utahs runs down
into the valley of the Rio del Norte upon the south.
Furthermore, that both are in possession of the horse,—the
Utahs owning large numbers,—that both are of
roving and predatory habits, and quite as wicked and
warlike as the generality of their red brethren.</p>

<p class='c016'>They are also as well to do in the world as most Indians;
but there are many degrees in their “civilization,”
or rather in the comforts of their life, depending upon
the situation in which they may be placed. When dwelling
upon a good “salmon-stream,” or among the rocky
mountain “parks,” that abound in game, they manage
to pass a portion of the year in luxuriant abundance.
In other places, however, and at other times, their existence
is irksome enough,—often bordering upon actual
starvation.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be further observed, that the Utahs and Snakes
usually occupy the larger and more fertile oases of the
desert,—wherever a tract is found of sufficient size to
subsist a community. With this observation I shall dismiss
both these tribes; for it is not of them that our
present sketch is intended to treat.</p>

<p class='c016'>This is specially designed for a far <i>odder</i> people than
either,—for the <i>Yamparicos</i>, or “Root-Diggers;” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>having described their country, I shall now proceed to
give some account of themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be necessary here to remark that the name
“Diggers,” has of late been very improperly applied,—not
only by the settlers of California, but by some of
the exploring officers of the United States government.
Every tribe or community throughout the desert, found
existing in a state of special wretchedness, has been so
styled; and a learned ethnologist (!), writing in the
“Examiner,” newspaper, gravely explains the name, by
deriving it from the gold-diggers of California! This
“conceit” of the London editor is a palpable absurdity,—since
the Digger Indians were so designated, long
before the first gold-digger of California put spade into
its soil. The name is of “trapper” origin; bestowed
upon these people from the observation of one of their
most common practices,—viz., the <i>digging for roots</i>,
which form an essential portion of their subsistence. The
term “yamparico,” is from a Spanish source, and has a
very similar meaning to that of “Root-digger.” It is
literally “Yampa-rooter,” or “Yampa-root eater,” the
root of the “yampah” (<i>anethum graviolens</i>) being their
favorite food. The true “Diggers” are not found in
California west of the Sierra Nevada; though certain
tribes of ill-used Indians in that quarter are called by
the name. The great deserts extending between the
Nevada and the Rocky Mountains are their locality;
and their limits are more or less cotemporaneous with
those of the Shoshonees or Snakes, and the Utahs,—of
both of which tribes they are supposed to be a sort of
outcast kindred. This hypothesis, however, rests only on
a slight foundation: that of some resemblance in habits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and language, which are very uncertain <i>criteria</i> where
two people dwell within the same boundaries,—as, for
instance, the whites and blacks in Virginia. In fact, the
language of the Diggers can scarce be called a language
at all: being a sort of gibberish like the growling of a
dog, eked out by a copious vocabulary of signs: and
perhaps, here and there, by an odd word from the Shoshonee
or Utah,—not unlikely, introduced by the association
of the Diggers with these last-mentioned tribes.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the western and southern division of the Great
Basin, the Digger exists under the name of <i>Paiute</i>, or
more properly, <i>Pah-Utah</i>,—so-called from his supposed
relationship with the tribe of the Utahs. In some respects
the Pah-Utahs differ from the Shoshokee, or
Snake-Diggers; though in most of their characteristic
habits they are very similar to each other. There might
be no anomaly committed by considering them as one
people; for in personal appearance and habits of life
the Pah-Utah, and the “Shoshokee”—this last is the
national appellation of the yampah-eater,—are as like
each other as <i>eggs</i>. We shall here speak however,
principally of the Shoshokees: leaving it to be understood,
that their neighbors the “Paiutes” will equally
answer the description.</p>

<p class='c016'>Although the Shoshokees, as already observed, dwell
within the same limits as their supposed kindred the
Shoshonees, they rarely or never associate with the latter.
On the contrary, they keep well out of their way,—inhabiting
only those districts of country where the
larger Shoshonee communities could not dwell. The
very smallest oasis, or the tiniest stream, affords all the
fertility that is required for the support of a Digger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>family; and rarely are these people found living more
than one, or at most, two or three families together.
The very necessity of their circumstances precludes the
possibility of a more extensive association; for on the
deserts where they dwell, neither the earth nor the air,
nor yet the water, affords a sufficient supply of food to
support even the smallest “tribe.” Not in tribes, then,
but in single families, or little groups of two or three, do
the Digger Indians dwell,—not in the larger and more
fertile valleys, but in those small and secluded; in the
midst of the sage-plains, or more frequently in the rocky
defiles of the mountains that stand thickly over the
“Basin.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Shoshokee is no <i>nomade</i>, but the very reverse.
A single and isolated mountain is often the abode of his
group or family; and beyond this his wanderings extend
not. There he is at home, knowing every nook and rat-hole
in his own neighborhood; but as ignorant of the
world beyond as the “sand-rats” themselves,—whose
pursuit occupies the greater portion of his time.</p>

<p class='c016'>In respect to his “settled” mode of life, the <i>Shoshokee</i>
offers a striking contrast to the <i>Shoshonee</i>. Many of the
latter are Indians of noble type,—warriors who have
tamed the horse, and who extend their incursions, both
hunting and hostile, into the very heart of the Rocky
Mountains,—up their fertile valleys, and across their
splendid “parks,” often bringing back with them the
scalps of the savage and redoubtable Blackfeet.</p>

<p class='c016'>Far different is the character of the wretched Shoshokeee,—the
mere semblance of a human being,—who
rarely strays out of the ravine in which he was
brought forth; and who, at sight of a human face—be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>it of friend or enemy—flies to his crag or cave like a
hunted beast!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Pah-Utah Diggers, however, are of a more warlike
disposition; or rather a more wicked and hostile
one,—hostile to whites, or even to such other Indians as
may have occasion to travel through the deserts they
inhabit. These people are found scattered throughout
the whole southern and southwestern portion of the
Great Basin,—and also in the northwestern part of the
Colorado desert,—especially about the Sevier River, and
on several of the tributaries of the great Colorado itself
of the west. It was through this part of the country
that the caravans from California to New Mexico used
to make their annual “trips,”—long before Alta Calafornia
became a possession of the United States,—and
the route by which they travelled is known as the <i>Spanish
trail</i>. The object of these caravans was the import
of horses, mules, and other animals,—from the fertile
valleys of the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers, to the
more sterile settlements of New Mexico. Several kinds
of goods were also carried into these interior countries.</p>

<p class='c016'>This Spanish trail was far from running in a direct
line. The sandy, waterless plain—known more particularly
as the Colorado desert—could not be crossed
with safety, and the caravan-route was forced far to the
north; and entered within the limits of the Great Basin—thus
bringing it through the county inhabited by the
Pah-Utah Diggers. The consequence was, that these
savages looked out annually for its arrival; and, whenever
an opportunity offered, stole the animals that accompanied
it, or murdered any of the men who might be
found straggling from the main body. When bent on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>such purposes, these Diggers for a time threw aside their
solitary habits,—assembling in large bands of several
hundred each, and following the caravan travellers, like
wolves upon the track of a gang of buffaloes. They never
made their attacks upon the main body, or when the
white men were in any considerable force. Only small
groups who had lagged behind, or gone too rashly in
advance, had to fear from these merciless marauders,—who
never thought of such a thing as making captives,
but murdered indiscriminately all who fell into their
hands. When horses or mules were captured, it was
never done with the intention of keeping them to ride
upon. Scarcely ever do the Pah-Utahs make such a
use of the horse. Only for food were these stolen or
plundered from their owners; and when a booty of this
kind was obtained, the animals were driven to some
remote defile among the mountains, and there slaughtered
outright. So long as a morsel of horse or mule
flesh remained upon the bones, the Diggers kept up a
scene of feasting and merriment—precisely similar to
the <i>carnivals</i> of the African Bushmen, after a successful
foray upon the cattle of the Dutch settlers near the Cape.
Indeed there is such a very striking resemblance between
the Bushmen of Africa and these Digger Indians of
North America; that, were it not for the distinction of
race, and some slight differences in personal appearance,
they might pass as one people. In nearly every habit
and custom, the two people resemble each other; and
in many mental characteristics they appear truly identical.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Pah-Utah Diggers have not yet laid aside their
hostile and predatory habits. They are at the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>hour engaged in plundering forays,—acting towards
the emigrant trains of Californian adventurers just as
they did towards the Spanish caravans. But they
usually meet with a very different reception from the
more daring Saxon travellers, who constitute the
“trains” now crossing their country; and not unfrequently
a terrible punishment is the reward of their
audacity. For all that, many of the emigrants, who
have been so imprudent as to travel in small parties,
have suffered at their hands, losing not only their property,
but their lives; since hundreds of the bravest men
have fallen by the arrows of these insignificant savages!
Even the exploring parties of the United States government,
accompanied by troops, have been attacked by
them; and more than one officer has fallen a victim to
their Ishmaelitish propensities.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not in open warfare that there is any dread of
them. The smallest party of whites need not fear to
encounter a hundred of them at once; but their attacks
are made by stealth, and under cover of the night; and,
as soon as they have succeeded in separating the horses
or other animals from the travellers’ camp, they drive
them off so adroitly that pursuit is impossible. Whenever
a grand blow has been struck—that is, a traveller
has been murdered—they all disappear as if by magic;
and for several days after not one is to be seen, upon
whom revenge might be taken. The numerous “smokes,”
rising up out of the rocky defiles of the mountains, are
then the only evidence that human beings are in the
neighborhood of the travellers’ camp.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Digger is different from other North-American
Indians,—both in physical organization and intellectual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>character. So low is he in the scale of both, as to
dispute with the African Bushman, the Andaman Islander,
and the starving savage of Tierra del Fuego, the
claim to that point in the transition, which is supposed
to separate the monkey from the man. It has been
variously awarded by ethnologists, and I as one have
had my doubts, as to which of the three is deserving
of the distinction. Upon mature consideration, however,
I have come to the conclusion that the Digger is entitled
to it.</p>

<p class='c016'>This miserable creature is of a dark-brown or copper
color,—the hue so generally known as characteristic
of the American aborigines. He stands about five feet
in height,—often under but rarely over this standard,—and
his body is thin and meagre, resembling that of a
frog stretched upon a fish-hook. The skin that covers it—especially
that of an old Digger—is wrinkled and
corrugated like the hide of an Asiatic rhinoceros,—with
a surface as dry as parched buck-skin. His feet, turned
in at the toes,—as with all the aborigines of America,—have
some resemblance to human feet; but in the
legs this resemblance ends. The lower limbs are almost
destitute of calves, and the knee-pans are of immense
size,—resembling a pair of pads or callosities, like those
upon goats and antelopes. The face is broad and angular,
with high cheek-bones; the eyes small, black, and
sunken, and sparkle in their hollow sockets, not with
true intelligence, but that sort of vivacity which may
often be observed in the lower animals, especially in
several species of monkeys. Throughout the whole
physical composition of the Digger, there is only one
thing that appeals luxuriant,—and that is his hair.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Like all Indians he is amply endowed in this respect,
and long, black tresses—sometimes embrowned by the
sun, and matted together with mud or other filth—hang
over his naked shoulders. Generally he crops them.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the summer months, the Digger’s costume is extremely
simple,—after the fashion of that worn by
our common parents, Adam and Eve. In winter, however,
the climate of his desert home is rigorous in the
extreme,—the mountains over his head, and the plains
under his feet, being often covered with snow. At this
season he requires a garment to shelter his body from
the piercing blast; and this he obtains by stitching together
a few skins of the sage-hare, so as to form a kind
of shirt or body-coat. He is not always rich enough to
have even a good coat of this simple material; and its
scanty skirt too often exposes his wrinkled limbs to the
biting frost.</p>

<p class='c016'>Between the Digger and his wife, or “squaw,” there
is not much difference either in costume or character.
The latter may be distinguished, by being of less stature,
rather than by any feminine graces in her physical or
intellectual conformation. She might be recognized,
too, by watching the employment of the family; for it
is she who does nearly all the work, stitches the rabbit-skin
shirt, digs the “yampa” and “kamas” roots,
gathers the “mezquite” pods, and gets together the
larder of “prairie-crickets.” Though lowest of all
American Indians in the scale of civilization, the Digger
resembles them all in this,—he regards himself as lord
and master, and the woman as his slave.</p>

<p class='c016'>As already observed, there is no such thing as a <i>tribe</i>
of Diggers,—nothing of the nature of a political organization;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>and the chief of their miserable little community—for
sometimes there is a head man—is only
he who is most regarded for his strength. Indeed, the
nature of their country would not admit of a large number
of them living together. The little valleys or
“oases”—that occur at intervals along the banks of
some lone desert stream,—would not, any one of them,
furnish subsistence to more than a few individuals,—especially
to savages ignorant of agriculture,—that is,
not knowing how to <i>plant</i> or <i>sow</i>. The Diggers, however,
if they know not how to <i>sow</i>, may be said to understand
something about how to <i>reap</i>, since <i>root-digging</i>
is one of their most essential employments,—that
occupation from which they have obtained their distinctive
appellation, in the language of the trappers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Not being agriculturists, you will naturally conclude
that they are either a pastoral people, or else a nation
of hunters. But in truth they are neither one nor
the other. They have no domestic animal,—many of
them not even the universal dog; and as to hunting,
there is no large game in their country. The buffalo
does not range so far west; and if he did, it is not likely
they could either kill or capture so formidable a creature;
while the prong-horned antelope, which does inhabit
their plains, is altogether too swift a creature, to
be taken by any wiles a Digger might invent. The
“big-horn,” and the black and white-tailed species of
deer, are also too shy and too fleet for their puny
weapons; and as to the grizzly bear, the very sight
of one is enough to give a Digger Indian the “chills.”</p>

<p class='c016'>If, then, they do not cultivate the ground, nor rear
some kind of animals, nor yet live by the chase, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>do these people manage to obtain subsistence? The
answer to this question appears a dilemma,—since it
has been already stated, that their country produces
little else than the wild and worthless sage-plant.</p>

<p class='c016'>Were we speaking of an Indian of tropical America,
or a native of the lovely islands of the great South Sea,
there would be no difficulty whatever in accounting for
his subsistence,—even though he neither planted nor
sowed, tended cattle, nor yet followed the chase. In
these regions of luxuriant vegetation, nature has been
bountiful to her children; and, it may be almost literally
alleged that the loaf of bread grows spontaneously on
the tree. But the very reverse is the case in the country
of the Digger Indian. Even the hand of cultivation
could scarce wring a crop from the sterile soil; and
Nature has provided hardly one article that deserves
the name of food.</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps you may fancy that the Digger is a fisherman;
and obtains his living from the stream, by the
side of which he makes his dwelling. Not even this
is permitted to him. It is true that his supposed kindred,
the Shoshonees, occasionally follow the occupation
of fishermen upon the banks of the Great Snake River,—which
at certain seasons of the year swarms with
the finest salmon; but the poor Digger has no share in
the finny spoil. The streams, that traverse his desert
home, empty their waters into the briny bosom of the
Great Salt Lake,—a true <i>Dead Sea</i>, where neither
salmon, nor any other fish could live for an instant.</p>

<p class='c016'>How then does the Digger obtain his food? Is he a
manufacturer,—and perforce a merchant,—who exchanges
with some other tribe his manufactured goods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>for provisions and “raw material?” Nothing of the
sort. Least of all is he a manufacturer. The hare-skin
shirt is his highest effort in the line of textile fabrics;
and his poor weak bow, and flint-tipped arrows, are the
only tools he is capable of making. Sometimes he is
even without these weapons; and may be seen with
another,—a long stick, with a hook at one end,—the
hook itself being the stump of a lopped branch, with
its natural inclination to that which forms the stick.
The object and purpose of this simple weapon we shall
presently describe.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Digger’s wife may be seen with a weapon
equally simple in its construction. This is also a stick—but
a much shorter one—pointed at one end, and
bearing some resemblance to a gardener’s “dibble.”
Sometimes it is tipped with horn,—when this can be
procured,—but otherwise the hard point is produced
by calcining it in the fire. This tool is essentially an
implement of husbandry,—as will presently appear.</p>

<p class='c016'>Let us now clear up the mystery, and explain how
the Digger maintains himself. There is not much
mystery after all. Although, as already stated, his
country produces nothing that could fairly be termed
<i>food</i>, yet there are a few articles within his reach upon
which a human being <i>might</i> subsist,—that is, might
just keep body and soul together. One of these articles
is the bean, or legume of the “mezquite” tree, of which
there are many kinds throughout the desert region.
They are known to Spanish Americans as <i>algarobia</i>
trees; and, in the southern parts of the desert, grow to
a considerable size,—often attaining the dimension of
twenty to twenty-five feet in height.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>They produce a large legume, filled with seeds and a
pulp of sweetish-acid taste,—similar to that of the
“honey-locust.” These beans are collected in large
quantities, by the squaw of the Digger, stowed away in
grass-woven baskets, or sometimes only in heaps in a
corner of his cave, or hovel, if he chance to have one.
If so, it is a mere wattle of artemisia, thatched and
“chinked” with grass.</p>

<p class='c016'>The mezquite seeds, then, are the <i>bread</i> of the Digger;
but, bad as is the quality, the supply is often far
behind the demands of his hungry stomach. For vegetables,
he has the “yampah” root, an umbelliferous
plant, which grows along the banks of the streams.
This, with another kind, known as “kamas” or “quamash”
(<i>Camassia esculenta</i>), is a spontaneous production;
and the digging for these roots forms, at a certain
season of the year, the principal occupation of the
women. The “dibble”-like instrument already described
is the <i>root-digger</i>. The roots here mentioned,
before being eaten, have to undergo a process of cooking.
The yampah is boiled in a very ingenious manner;
but this piece of ingenuity is not native to the
Shoshokees, and has been obtained from their more
clever kindred, the Snakes. The pot is a <i>wooden one</i>;
and yet they can boil meat in it, or make soup if they
wish! Moreover, it is only a basket, a mere vessel of
wicker-work! How, then, can water be boiled in it?
If you had not been already told how it is done, it
would no doubt puzzle you to find out.</p>

<p class='c016'>But most likely you have read of a somewhat similar
vessel among the Chippewa Indians,—especially the
tribe known as the “Assineboins,” or ‘stone-boilers’—who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>cook their fish or flesh in pots made of birch-bark.
The phrase <i>stone-boilers</i> will suggest to you how the
difficulty is got over. The birch-bark pot is not set over
fire; but stones are heated and thrown into it,—of
course already filled with water. The hot stones soon
cause the water to simmer, and fresh ones are added
until it boils, and the meat is sufficiently cooked. By
just such a process the “Snakes” cook their salmon
and deer’s flesh,—their wicker pots being woven of so
close a texture that not even water can pass through the
interstices.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is not often, however, that the Digger is rich enough
to have one of these wicker pots,—and when he has,
he is often without anything to put into it.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>kamas</i> roots are usually baked in a hole dug in
the earth, and heated by stones taken from the fire. It
requires nearly two days to bake them properly; and
then, when taken out of the “oven,” the mass bears a
strong resemblance to soft glue or size, and has a sweet
and rather agreeable taste,—likened to that of baked
pears or quinces.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have not yet specified the whole of the Digger’s
larder. Were he to depend altogether on the roots and
seeds already mentioned, he would often have to starve,—and
in reality he often <i>does</i> starve,—for, even with
the additional supplies which his sterile soil scantily furnishes
him, he is frequently the victim of famine.</p>

<p class='c016'>There may be a bad season of the mezquite-crop, and
the bears—who are as cunning “diggers” as he—sometimes
destroy his “plantations” of yampah and
kamas. He finds a resource, however, in the <i>prairie-cricket</i>,
an insect—or reptile, you may call it—of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span><i>gryllus</i> tribe, of a dark-brown color, and more like a bug
than any other crawler. These, at certain seasons of
the year, make their appearance upon the desert plains,
and in such numbers that the ground appears to be alive
with them. An allied species has of late years become
celebrated: on account of a visit paid by vast numbers
of them to the Mormon plantations; where, as may be
remembered, they devastated the crops,—just as the
locusts do in Africa,—causing a very severe season of
famine among these isolated people. It may be remembered
also, that flocks of white birds followed the movements
of these American locusts,—preying upon them,
and thinning their multitudinous hosts.</p>

<p class='c016'>These birds were of the gull genus (<i>Larus</i>), and one
of the most beautiful of the species. They frequent the
shores and islands of the rivers of <i>Prairie-land</i>, living
chiefly upon such insects as are found in the neighborhood
of their waters. It was but natural, therefore, they
should follow the locusts, or “grasshoppers,” as the Mormons
termed them; but the <i>pseudo-prophet</i> of these deluded
people could not suffer to pass such a fine opportunity
of proving his divine inspiration: which he did
by audaciously declaring that the birds were “heaven-born,”
and had been sent by the Almighty (in obedience
to a prayer from him, the prophet) to rid the country of
the pest of the grasshoppers!</p>

<p class='c016'>These prairie-crickets are of a dark-brown color,—not
unlike the <i>gryllus migratorius</i> of Africa, and with very
similar habits. When settled thickly upon the ground,
the whole surface assumes a darkish hue, as if covered
with crape; and when they are all in motion,—creeping
to and fro in search of their food,—a very singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>effect is produced. At this time they do not take to
wing; though they attempt to get out of the way, by
making short hops from place to place, and crawling
with great rapidity. Notwithstanding their efforts to
escape, hundreds of them are “squashed” beneath
the foot of the pedestrian, or hoofs of the traveller’s
horse.</p>

<p class='c016'>These crickets, with several bug-like insects of different
species, furnish the Digger with an important
article of food. It may appear a strange provender
for a human stomach; but there is nothing unnatural
about it,—any more than about the eating of shrimps
or prawns; and it will be remembered that the Bushmen,
and many other tribes of South Africa eat the
<i>gryllus migratorius</i>; while, in the northern part of that
same continent, many nations regard them as a proper
article of food. Though some writers have asserted,
that it was the legume of the locust-tree (an acacia)
which was eaten by St. John the Baptist in the wilderness,
it is easily proved that such was not the case.
That his food was the locust (<i>gryllus migratorius</i>) and
wild honey, is strictly and literally true; and at the
present day, were you to visit the “wilderness” mentioned
by the Apostle, you might see people living upon
“locusts and wild-honey,” just as they did eighteen hundred
years ago.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Diggers <i>cook</i> their crickets sometimes by boiling
them in the pots aforementioned, and sometimes by
“roasting.” They also mix them with the mezquite
seeds and pulp,—the whole forming a kind of plum-pudding,
or “cricket-pasty,”—or, as it is jocosely termed
by the trappers, “cricket-cake.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Their mode of collecting the grasshoppers is not without
some display of ingenuity. When the insects are
in abundance, there is not much difficulty in obtaining a
sufficient supply; but this is not always the case. Sometimes
they appear very sparsely upon the plains; and,
being nimble in their movements, are not easily laid hold
of. Only one could be taken at a time; and, by gleaning
in this way, a very limited supply would be obtained.
To remedy this, the Diggers have invented a somewhat
ingenious contrivance for capturing them wholesale,—which
is effected in the following manner:—When the
whereabouts of the grasshoppers has been discovered, a
round hole—of three or four feet in diameter, and of
about equal depth—is scooped out in the centre of the
plain. It is shaped somewhat after the fashion of a
kiln; and the earth, that has been taken out, is carried
out of the way.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Digger community then all turn out—men, women,
and children—and deploy themselves into a wide
circle, enclosing as large a tract as their numbers will
permit. Each individual is armed with a stick, with
which he beats the sage-bushes, and makes other violent
demonstrations: the object being to frighten the
grasshoppers, and cause them to move inward towards
the pit that has been dug. The insects, thus beset,
move as directed,—gradually approaching the centre,—while
the “beaters” follow in a circle constantly
lessening in circumference. After a time the crickets,
before only thinly scattered over the plain,—grow
more crowded as the space becomes contracted; until
at length the surface is covered with a black moving
swarm, and the beaters, still pressing upon them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>driving them onward, force the whole body pellmell
over the edges of the pit.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bunches of grass, already provided are now flung over
them, and upon that a few shovelfuls of earth or sand;
and then—horrible to relate!—a large pile of artemisia stalks
is heaped upon the top and set on fire! The result
is that, in a few minutes, the poor grasshoppers are
smoked to death, and parched at the same time—so as
to be ready for eating, whenever the <i>débris</i> of the fire
has been removed.</p>

<p class='c016'>The prairie-cricket is not the only article of the <i>flesh-meat</i>
kind, found in the larder of the Digger. Another
animal furnishes him with an occasional meal. This is
the “sage-hare,” known to hunters as the “sage-rabbit,”
but to naturalists as the <i>lepus artemisia</i>. It is a very
small animal,—less in size than the common rabbit,—though
it is in reality a true hare. It is of a silvery, or
whitish-gray color—which adapts it to the hue of the
<i>artemisia</i> bushes on the stalks and berries of which it
feeds.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is from the skins of this animal, that the Digger
women manufacture the rabbit-skin shirts, already described.
Its flesh would not be very agreeable to a
European palate,—even with the addition of an onion,—for
it has the sage flavor to such a degree, as to be
as bitter as wormwood itself. An onion with it would
not be tasted! But tastes differ, and by the Digger the
flesh of the sage-hare is esteemed one of the nicest delicacies.
He hunts it, therefore, with the greatest assiduity;
and the chase of this insignificant animal is to the
Digger, what the hunt of the stag, the elephant, or the
wild boar, is to hunters of a more pretentious ambition.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>With his bow and arrows he frequently succeeds in
killing a single hare; but this is not always so easy,—since
the sage-hare, like all of its kind, is shy, swift, and
cunning. Its color, closely resembling the hue of the
artemisia foliage, is a considerable protection to it; and
it can hide among these bushes, where they grow thickly—as
they generally do—over the surface of the
ground.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the Digger is not satisfied with the scanty and
uncertain supply, which his weak bow and arrows would
enable him to obtain. As in the case of the grasshoppers,
he has contrived a plan for capturing the sage-hares
by wholesale.</p>

<p class='c016'>This he accomplishes by making a “surround,” and
driving the animals, not into a <i>pit</i>, but into a <i>pound</i>.
The pound is constructed something after the same fashion
as that used by the Chippewas, and other northern
Indians, for capturing the herds of reindeer; in other
words, it is an enclosure, entered by a narrow mouth—from
the <i>jaws</i> of which mouth, two fences are carried far
out into the plain, in a gradually diverging direction.
For the deer and other large animals, the fences of the
pound—as also those of the funnel that conducts to it,
require to be made of strong stakes, stockaded side by
side; but this work, as well as the timber with which to
construct it, is far beyond the reach of the Digger. His
enclosure consists of a mere wattle of artemisia stalks
and branches, woven into a row of those already standing—with
here and there a patching of rude nets, made
of roots and grass. The height is not over three feet
and the sage-hare might easily spring over it; but the
stupid creature, when once “in the pound,” never thinks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>of looking upward; but continues to dash its little skull
against the wattle, until it is either “clubbed” by the
Digger, or impaled upon one of his obsidian arrows.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other quadrupeds, constituting a portion of the Digger’s
food, are several species of “gophers,” or sand-rats,
ground-squirrels, and marmots. In many parts of the
Great Basin, the small rodents abound: dwelling between
the crevices of rocks, or honeycombing the dry
plains with their countless burrows. The Digger captures
them by various wiles. One method is by shooting
them with blunt arrows; but the more successful plan
is, by setting a trap at the entrance to their earthen
caves. It is the “figure of 4 trap,” which the Digger
employs for this purpose, and which he constructs with
ingenuity,—placing a great many around a “warren,”
and often taking as many as fifty or sixty “rats” in a
single day!</p>

<p class='c016'>In weather too cold for the gophers to come out of
their caves, the Digger then “digs” for them: thus further
entitling him to his special appellation.</p>

<p class='c016'>That magnificent bird, the “cock of the plains,” sometimes
furnishes the Digger with “fowl” for his dinner.
This is a bird of the grouse family (<i>tetrao urophasianus</i>),
and the largest species that is known,—exceeding in
size the famed “cock of the woods” of northern Europe.
A full-fledged cock of the plains is as large as an eagle;
and, unlike most of the grouse kind, has a long, narrow
body. His plumage is of a silvery gray color—produced
by a mottle of black and white,—no doubt, given
him by a nature to assimilate him to the hue of the artemisia,—amidst
which he habitually dwells, and the berries
of which furnish him with most of his food.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>He is remarkable for two large <i>goitre-like</i> swellings on
the breast, covered with a sort of hair instead of feathers;
but, though a fine-looking large bird, and a grouse
too, his flesh is bitter and unpalatable—even more so
than that of the sage-hare. For all that, it is a delicacy
to the Digger, and a rare one; for the cock of the plains
is neither plentiful, nor easily captured when seen.</p>

<p class='c016'>There are several other small animals—both quadrupeds
and birds—inhabiting Digger-land, upon which
an occasional meal is made. Indeed, the food of the
Digger is sufficiently varied. It is not in the quality
but the quantity he finds most cause of complaint: for
with all his energies he never gets enough. In the summer
season, however, he is less stinted. Then the berries
of the buffalo-bush are ripe; and these, resembling
currants, he collects in large quantities,—placing
his rabbit-skin wrapper under the bush, and shaking
down the ripe fruit in showers. A <i>mélange</i> of prairie-crickets
and buffalo-berries is esteemed by the Digger,
as much as would be the best specimen of a “currant-cake”
in any nursery in Christendom!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Digger finds a very curious species of edible bug,
which builds its nest on the ledges of the cliffs,—especially
those that overhang a stream. These nests are
of a conical or pine-apple shape, and about the size of
this fruit.</p>

<p class='c016'>This bug,—not yet classified or described by entomologists,—is
of a dark brown color, about the size of
the ordinary cockroach; and when boiled is considered
a proper article of food,—not only by the unfastidious
Diggers, but by Indians of a more epicurean <i>goût</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides the yampah and kamas, there are several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>other edible roots found in the Digger country. Among
others may be mentioned a species of thistle (<i>cirsium virginiarum</i>),—the
root of which grows to the size of an
ordinary carrot, and is almost as well flavored. It requires
a great deal of roasting, or boiling, before it is
sufficiently cooked to be eaten.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>kooyah</i> is another article of food still more popular
among Digger gourmands. This is the root of the
<i>valeriana edulis</i>. It is of a bright-yellow color, and
grows to a considerable size. It has the characteristic
odor of the well-known plant; but not so strong as in
the prepared substance of <i>valerian</i>. The plant itself
does not grow in the arid soil of the desert, but rather
in the rich fertile bottoms of the streams, or along the
shores of marshy lakes,—in company with the kamas
and yampah. It is when these roots are in season, that
the Shoshokees most frequent such localities; and, indeed,
this same season is the time when all other articles
of Digger food are plenteous enough,—the summer.
The winter months are to him the “tight times.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In some parts of the desert country, as already observed,
grow species of pines, with edible cones,—or
rather edible seeds which the cones contain. These
seeds resemble nuts, and are about the size of the common
filberts.</p>

<p class='c016'>More than one species of pine produces this sort of
food; but in the language of the Spanish Californians
and New Mexicans, they are all indifferently termed
<i>piñon</i>, and the seeds simply <i>piñones</i>, or “piñons.” Where
these are within the reach of the Digger,—as they are
in some districts,—he is then well provided for; since
the piñons, when roasted, not only form an agreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>and nutritious article of food, but can be stored up as a
winter stock,—that will keep for a considerable time,
without danger of spoiling, or growing too stale.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such is the <i>commissariat</i> of the Digger Indian; and,
poor in quality though it be, there are times when he
cannot obtain a sufficient supply of it. At such times
he has recourse to food of a still meaner kind,—to
roots, scarce eatable, and even to the seeds of several
species of grass! Worms, grubs, the <i>agama cornuta</i>, or
“horned-frog of the prairies,” with other species of lizards,
become his sole resource; and in the search and
capture of these he occupies himself from morning to
night.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is in this employment that he finds use for the long
sapling, with the hooked end upon it,—the hook being
used for dragging the lizards out of clefts in the rocks,
within which they have sought shelter. In the accomplishment
of this, the Digger displays an adroitness that
astonishes the traveller: often “jerking” the reptile out
of some dark crevice within which it might be supposed
to have found a retreat secure from all intruders.</p>

<p class='c016'>Many other curious habits might be related of this
abject and miserable race of human beings; but perhaps
enough has been detailed, to secure them a place
in the list of our “odd people.”</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE GUARAONS, OR PALM-DWELLERS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>Young reader, I may take it for granted that you
have heard of the great river Orinoco,—one of the
largest rivers not only of South America, but in the
world. By entering at its mouth, and ascending to its
source, you would have to make a journey of about one
thousand five hundred miles; but this journey, so far
from being direct, or in a straight line, would carry you
in a kind of spiral curve,—very much like the figure 6,
the apex of the figure representing the mouth of the
river. In other words, the Orinoco, rising in the unexplored
mountains of Spanish Guiana, first runs eastward;
and then, having turned gradually to every point of the
compass, resumes its easterly course, continuing in this
direction till it empties its mighty flood into the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p class='c016'>Not by one mouth, however. On the contrary, long
before the Orinoco approaches the sea, its channel separates
into a great many branches (or “caños,” as they
are called in the language of the country), each of which,
slowly meandering in its own course, reaches the coast
by a separate mouth, or “boca.” Of these caños there
are about fifty, embracing within their ramifications a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>“delta” nearly half as large as England! Though they
have all been distinguished by separate names, only three
or four of them are navigable by ships of any considerable
size; and, except to the few pilots whose duty
it is to conduct vessels into that main channel of the
river, the whole delta of the Orinoco may be regarded
as a country still unexplored, and almost unknown. Indeed,
the same remark might be made of the whole
river, were it not for the magnificent monument left by
the great traveller Von Humboldt,—whose narrative
of the exploration of the Orinoco is, beyond all comparison,
the finest book of travels yet given to the world.
To him are we chiefly indebted for our knowledge of
the Orinoco; since the Spanish nation, who, for more
than three centuries, have held undisputed possession of
this mighty stream, have left us scarce a line about it
worth either credit or record.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is now more than half a century, since the date
of Humboldt’s “Personal Narrative;” and yet, strange
to say, during all that period, scarce an item has been
added to our knowledge of the Orinoco, beyond what
this scientific traveller had already told us. Indeed,
there is not much to say: for there has been little
change in the river since then,—either in the aspect of
nature, or the condition of man. What change there
has been possesses rather a retrograde, than a progressive
character. Still, now, as then, on the banks
of the Orinoco, we behold a languid commerce,—characteristic
of the decaying Spano-American race,—and
the declining efforts of a selfish and bigoted missionary
zeal, whose boasted aim of “christianizing and civilizing”
has ended only in producing a greater <i>brutalization</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>After three centuries of <i>paternosters</i> and bell-ringing,
the red savage of the Orinoco returns to the worship
of his ancestral gods,—or to no worship at all,—and
for this backsliding he can, perhaps, give a sufficient
reason.</p>

<p class='c016'>Pardon me, young reader, for this digression. It is
not my purpose to discuss the polemical relations of
those who inhabit the banks of the Orinoco; but to give
you some account of a very singular people who dwell
near its mouth,—upon the numerous caños, already
mentioned as constituting its delta. These are the
“Guaraons,”—a tribe of Indians,—usually considered
as a branch of the Great Carib family, but forming a
community among themselves of seven or eight thousand
souls; and differing so much from most other
savages in their habits and mode of life, as fairly to
entitle them to the appellation of an “Odd People.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Orinoco, like many other large rivers, is subject
to a periodical rise and fall; that is, once every year, the
river swells to a great height above its ordinary level.
The swelling or “flood” was for a long time supposed
to proceed from the melting of snow upon the cordilleras
of the Andes,—in which mountains several of the
tributaries of the Orinoco have their rise. This hypothesis,
however, has been shown to be an incorrect
one: since the main stream of the Orinoco does not
proceed from the Andes, nor from any other snow-capped
mountains; but has its origin, as already stated,
in the <i>sierras</i> of Guiana. The true cause of its periodical
rising, therefore, is the vast amount of rain which
falls within the tropics; and this is itself occasioned by
the sun’s course across the torrid zone, which is also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>cause of its being periodical or “annual.” So exact is
the time at which these rains fall, and produce the floods
of the Orinoco, that the inhabitants of the river can
tell, within a few days, when the rising will commence,
and when the waters will reach their lowest!</p>

<p class='c016'>The flood season very nearly corresponds to our own
summer,—the rise commencing in April, and the river
being at its maximum height in August,—while the
minimum is again reached in December. The height
to which the Orinoco rises has been variously estimated
by travellers: some alleging it to be nearly one
hundred feet; while others estimate it to be only
fifty, or even less! The reason of this discrepancy
may be, that the measurements have been made at
different points,—at each of which, the actual height
to which the flood attains, may be greater or less
than at the others. At any one place, however, the
rise is the same—or very nearly so—in successive
years. This is proved by observations made at the
town of Angostura,—the lowest Spanish settlement of
any importance upon the Orinoco. There, nearly in
front of the town, a little rocky islet towers up in the
middle of the river; the top of which is just fifty feet
above the bed of the stream, when the volume of water
is at its minimum. A solitary tree stands upon the
pinnacle of this rock; and each year, when the water
is in full flood, the tree alone is visible,—the islet being
entirely submerged. From this peculiar circumstance,
the little islet has obtained the name of “Orinocometer,”
or measurer of the Orinoco.</p>

<p class='c016'>The rise here indicated is about fifty feet; but it
does not follow from this, that throughout its whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>course the river should annually rise to so great a
height. In reality it does not.</p>

<p class='c016'>At Angostura, as the name imports, the river is
<i>narrowed</i> to less than half its usual width,—being
there confined between high banks that impinge upon
its channel. Above and below, it widens again; and,
no doubt, in proportion to this widening will the annual
rise be greater or less. In fact, at many places, the
width of the stream is no longer that of its ordinary
channel; but, on the contrary, a vast “freshet” or inundation,
covering the country for hundreds of miles,—here
flooding over immense marshes or grassy plains,
and hiding them altogether,—there flowing among
forests of tall trees, the tops of which alone project
above the tumult of waters! These inundations are
peculiarly observable in the <i>delta</i> of the Orinoco,—where
every year, in the months of July and August,
the whole surface of the country becomes changed into
a grand fresh-water sea: the tops of the trees alone
rising above the flood, and proclaiming that there is
<i>land</i> at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c016'>At this season the ordinary channels, or <i>caños</i>, would
be obliterated; and navigation through them become
difficult or impossible, but for the tree-tops; which, after
the manner of “buoys” and signal-marks, serve to guide
the pilots through the intricate mazes of the “bocas del
Orinoco.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Now it is this annual inundation, and the semi-submergence
of these trees under the flood, that has given
origin to the peculiar people of whom we are about to
speak,—the Guaraons; or, perhaps, we should rather
say, from these causes have arisen their strange habits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>and modes of life which entitle them to be considered
an “odd people.”</p>

<p class='c016'>During the period of the inundation, if you should sail
up the southern or principal caño of the Orinoco,—known
as the “boca de navios,” or “ships’ mouth,”—and
keep your face to the northward, you would behold
the singular spectacle of a forest growing out of the
water! In some places you would perceive single trees,
with the upper portion of their straight, branchless trunks
rising vertically above the surface, and crowned by about
a dozen great fan-shaped leaves, radiating outwards from
their summits. At other places, you would see many
crowded together, their huge fronds meeting, and forming
close clumps, or “water groves,” whose deep-green
color contrasts finely as it flings its reflection on the glistening
surface below.</p>

<p class='c016'>Were it night,—and your course led you through one
of the smaller caños in the northern part of the delta,—you
would behold a spectacle yet more singular, and
more difficult to be explained; a spectacle that astounded
and almost terrified the bold navigators, who first ventured
to explore these intricate coasts. You would not
only perceive a forest, growing out of the water; but,
high up among the tops of the trees, you would behold
blazing fires,—not the conflagration of the trees themselves,
as if the forest were in flames,—but fires regularly
built, glowing as from so many furnaces, and casting
their red glare upwards upon the broad green leaves,
and downwards upon the silvery surface of the water!</p>

<p class='c016'>If you should chance to be near enough to these fires,
you would see cooking utensils suspended over them;
human forms, both of men and women, seated or squatting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>around them; other human forms, flitting like shadows
among the tops of the trees; and down below, upon
the surface of the water, a fleet of canoes (<i>periaguas</i>),
fastened with their mooring-ropes to the trunks. All
this would surprise you,—as it did the early navigators,—and,
very naturally, you would inquire what it could
mean. Fires apparently suspended in the air! human
beings moving about among the tops of the trees, talking,
laughing, and gesticulating! in a word, acting just as any
other savages would do,—for these human beings <i>are</i>
savages,—amidst the tents of their encampment, or the
houses of their village. In reality it is a village upon
which you are gazing,—a village suspended in the air,—a
village of the Guaraon Indians!</p>

<p class='c016'>Let us approach nearer; let us steal into this water-village—for
it would not be always safe to enter it,
except by stealth—and see how its singular habitations
are constructed, as also in what way their occupants
manage to get their living. The village under our observation
is now,—at the period of inundation,—nearly
a hundred miles from shore, or from any dry land: it
will be months before the waters can subside; and, even
then, the country around will partake more of the nature
of a quagmire, than of firm soil; impassable to any
human being,—though <i>not</i> to a Guaraon, as we shall
presently see. It is true, the canoes, already mentioned,
might enable their owners to reach the firm shores beyond
the delta; and so they do at times; but it would
be a voyage too long and too arduous to be made often,—as
for the supply of food and other daily wants,—and
it is not for this purpose the canoes are kept. No
these Guaraons visit terra firma only at intervals; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>then for purposes of trade with a portion of their own and
other tribes who dwell there; but they permanently reside
within the area of the inundated forests; where they are
independent, not only of foreign aggression, but also for
their supply of all the necessaries of life. In these forests,
whether flooded or not, they procure everything of
which they stand in need,—they there find, to use an
old-fashioned phrase, “meat, drink, washing, and lodging.”
In other words: were the inundation to continue
forever, and were the Guaraons entirely prohibited from
intercourse with the dry land, they could still find subsistence
in this, their home upon the waters.</p>

<p class='c016'>Whence comes their subsistence? No doubt you will
say that fish is their food; and drink, of course, they
have in abundance; but this would not be the true explanation.
It is true they eat fish, and turtle, and the
flesh of the <i>manatee</i>, or “fish-cow,”—since the capturing
of these aquatic creatures is one of the chief occupations
of the Guaraons,—but they are oft times entirely
without such food; for, it is to be observed, that, during
the period of the inundations fish are not easily caught,
sometimes not at all. At these times the Guaraons
would starve—since, like all other savages, they are
improvident—were it not that the singular region they
inhabit supplies them with another article of food,—one
that is inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='c016'>What is this food, and from whence derived? It will
scarce surprise you to hear that it is the produce of the
trees already mentioned; but perhaps you <i>will</i> deem it
singular when I tell you that the trees of this great <i>water-forest</i>
are all of one kind,—all of the same species,—so
that here we have the remarkable fact of a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>species of vegetable, growing without care or cultivation,
and supplying all the wants of man,—his food, clothing,
fuel, utensils, ropes, houses, and boats,—not even drink
excepted, as will presently be seen.</p>

<p class='c016'>The name of this wonderful tree? “Itá,” the Guaraons
call it; though it is more generally known as
“morichi” among the Spanish inhabitants of the Orinoco;
but I shall here give my young reader an account
of it, from which he will learn something more than its
name.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>itá</i> is a true palm-tree, belonging to the genus
<i>mauritia</i>; and, I may remark, that notwithstanding the
resemblance in sound, the name of the genus is not derived
from the words “morichi,” “murichi,” or “muriti,”
all of which are different Indian appellations of this tree.
<i>Mauritia</i> is simply a Latinized designation borrowed
from the name of Prince Maurice of Nassau, in whose
honor the genus was named. The resemblance, therefore,
is merely accidental. I may add, too, that there are
many species of <i>mauritia</i> growing in different parts of
tropical America,—some of them palms of large size,
and towering height, with straight, smooth trunks; while
others are only tiny little trees, scarce taller than a man,
and with their trunks thickly covered with conical protuberances
or spines.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some of them, moreover, affect a high, dry soil, beyond
the reach of floods; while others do not prosper,
except on tracts habitually marshy, or annually covered
with inundations. Of these latter, the <i>itá</i> is perhaps the
most conspicuous; since we have already stated, that
for nearly six months of the year it grows literally out
of the water.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Like all its congeners, the itá is a “fan-palm;” that
is, its leaves, instead of being <i>pinnately</i> divided, as in
most species of palms, or altogether <i>entire</i>, as in some
few, radiate from the midrib of the leaf-stalk, into
a broad palmated shape, bearing considerable resemblance
to a fan when opened to its full extent. At the
tips these leaflets droop slightly, but at that end where
they spring out of the midrib, they are stiff and rigid.
The petiole, or leafstalk itself, is long, straight, and
thick; and where it clasps the stem or trunk, is swollen
out to a foot in width, hollowed, or concave on the upper
side. A full-grown leaf, with its petiole, is a wonderful
object to look upon. The stalk is a solid beam full
twelve feet in length, and the leaf has a diameter of
nearly as much. Leaf and stalk together make a load,
just as much as one man can carry upon his shoulders!</p>

<p class='c016'>Set about a dozen of these enormous leaves on the
summit of a tall cylindrical column of five feet in circumference,
and about one hundred in height,—place
them with their stalks clasping or sheathing its top,—so
that the spreading fans will point in every direction
outwards, inclining slightly upwards; do this, and you
will have the great <i>morichi</i> palm. Perhaps, you may
see the trunk swollen at its middle or near the top,—so
that its lower part is thinner than above,—but more
often the huge stem is a perfect cylinder. Perhaps you
may see several of the leaves drooping downward, as
if threatening to fall from the tree; you may even see
them upon the ground where they have fallen, and a
splendid ruin they appear. You may see again rising
upward out of the very centre of the crown of foliage,
a straight, thick-pointed column. This is the young leaf
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>in process of development,—its tender leaflets yet unopened,
and closely clasped together. But the fervid
tropical sun soon produces expansion; and a new fan
takes the place of the one that has served its time and
fallen to the earth,—there to decay, or to be swept
off by the flood of waters.</p>

<p class='c016'>Still more may be noticed, while regarding this noble
palm. Out of that part of the trunk,—where it is
embraced by the sheathing bases of the petioles,—at a
certain season of the year, a large spathe will be seen
to protrude itself, until it has attained a length of several
feet. This spathe is a bract-like sheath, of an imperfect
tubular form. It bursts open; and then appears the
huge spadix of flowers, of a whitish-green color, arranged
along the flower-stalk in rows,—<i>pinnately</i>. It
will be observed, moreover, that these spadices are different
upon different trees; for it must be remembered
that the mauritia palm is <i>diœcious</i>,—that is, having the
female flowers on one tree, and the male or staminiferous
flowers upon another. After the former have
glowed for a time in the heat of the sun, and received
the fertilizing pollen wafted to them by the breeze,—carried
by bee or bird, or transported by some unknown
and mysterious agency of nature,—the fruits take form
and ripen. These, when fully ripe, have attained to
the size of a small apple, and are of a very similar form.
They are covered with small brown, smooth scales,—giving
them somewhat the appearance of fir-cones, except
that they are roundish instead of being cone-shaped.
Underneath the scales there is a thinnish layer of pulp,
and then the stone or <i>nut</i>. A single spadix will
carry several hundreds—thousands, I might say—of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>these nuts; and the whole bunch is a load equal to the
strength of two ordinary men!</p>

<p class='c016'>Such is the itá palm. Now for its uses,—the uses
to which it is put by the Guaraons.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the Guaraon wishes to build himself a habitation,
he does not begin by digging a foundation in the
earth. In the spongy soil on which he stands, that
would be absurd. At a few inches below the surface
he would reach water; and he might dig to a vast depth
without finding firm ground. But he has no idea of
laying a foundation upon the ground, or of building a
house there. He knows that in a few weeks the river
will be rising; and would overtop his roof, however
high he might make it. His foundation, therefore, instead
of being laid in the ground, is placed far above it,—just
so far, that when the inundation is at its height
the floor of his dwelling will be a foot or two above it.
He does not take this height from guesswork. That
would be a perilous speculation. He is guided by certain
marks upon the trunks of palm-trees,—notches
which he has himself made on the preceding year, or
the natural watermark, which he is able to distinguish
by certain appearances on the trees. This point once
determined, he proceeds to the building of his house.</p>

<p class='c016'>A few trunks are selected, cut down, and then split
into beams of sufficient length. Four fine trees, standing
in a quadrangle, have already been selected to form
the corner-posts. In each of these, just above the
watermark, is cut a deep notch with a horizontal base to
serve as a rest for the cross-beams that are to form the
foundation of the structure. Into these notches the
beams are hoisted,—by means of ropes,—and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>securely tied. To reach the point where the platform
is to be erected—sometimes a very high elevation—ladders
are necessary; and these are of native manufacture,—being
simply the trunk of a palm-tree, with
notches cut in it for the toes of the climber. These
afterwards serve as a means of ascending and descending
to the surface of the water, during the period of
its rise and fall. The main timbers having been firmly
secured in their places, cross-beams are laid upon them,
the latter being either pieces of the split trunks, or,
what is usually easier to obtain, the petioles of the great
leaves,—each of which, as already stated, forms of
itself a large beam, twelve feet in length and from six
to twelves inches in breadth. These are next secured
at both ends by ropes of the palm-fibre.</p>

<p class='c016'>Next comes a layer of palm-leaves, the strong, tough
leaflets serving admirably as laths to uphold the coating
of mud, which is laid thickly over them. The mud is
obtained from below, without difficulty, and in any quantity
required; and when trowelled smooth, and dry,—which
it soon becomes under the hot sun,—constitutes
an excellent floor, where a fire may be kindled without
danger of burning either the laths or joists underneath.</p>

<p class='c016'>As yet the Guaraon has completed only the floor of
his dwelling, but that is his principal labor. He cares
not for walls,—neither sides nor gables. There is no
cold, frosty weather to chill him in his tropical home,—no
snow to be kept out. The rain alone, usually falling
in a vertical direction, has to be guarded against; and
from this he secures himself by a second platform of
lighter materials, covered with mats, which he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>already woven for the purpose, and with palm-leaflets
so placed as to cast off the heaviest shower. This also
shelters him against the burning sun,—an enemy
which he dreads even more than the rain.</p>

<p class='c016'>His house is now finished; and, with the exception of
the mud floor, is all of itá palm,—beams, cross-timbers,
laths, ropes, and mats. The ropes he has obtained by
stripping off the epidermis of the full-grown leaflets,
and then twisting it into cordage of any thickness required.
For this purpose it is equal to hemp. The
mats he has made from the same material,—and well
does he, or rather his wife—for this is usually the work
of the females—know how to plait and weave them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having completed the building of his aerial dwelling,
the Guaraon would eat. He has fish, which has been
caught in the neighboring caño,—perhaps turtle,—perhaps
the flesh of the manatee, or the alligator,—for
his palate is by no means of a delicate fineness, and
will not refuse a steak from the tail of the American
crocodile. But when the flood time is on, fish become
scarce, or cannot be had at all,—no more can turtles,
or sea-cows, or alligators. Besides, scarce or plenty,
something else is wanted to vary the diet. Bread is
wanted; and for this the Guaraon has not far to go.
The itá again befriends him, for he finds, upon splitting
open its trunk, a large deposit of medullary pith or
fecula; which, when submitted to the process of bruising
or grating, and afterwards stirred in water, forms a
sediment at the bottom of the vessel, a substance not
only eatable, but equal in excellence to the well-known
produce of the <i>sago</i> palm.</p>

<p class='c016'>This farinaceous pith, formed into cakes and roasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>over the fire,—the fuel being supplied by leaves and
leafstalks,—constitutes the <i>yuruma</i>,—the daily bread
of the Guaraon.</p>

<p class='c016'>The yuruma, or rather the sago out of which it is
made, is not obtainable at all times. It is the male
palm which produces it; and it must be extracted just
as the tree is about to expand its spadix of flowers.
The same curious fact is observed with regard to the
<i>maguey</i>, or great American aloe, which produces the
drink called “pulque.” To procure the sap in any
considerable quantity, the maguey must be tapped just
on that day when the flower-stalk is about to shoot
upward from among the leaves.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Guaraon, having eaten his yuruma, would drink.
Does he have recourse to the water which flows in
abundance beneath his dwelling? No. On ordinary
occasions he may quench his thirst in that way; but he
wishes for some beverage more cheering. Again the
itá yields it without stint, and even gives him a choice.
He may tap the trunk, and draw forth the sap; which,
after being submitted to a process of fermentation, becomes
a wine,—“ßmurichi wine,” a beverage which, if
the Guaraon be so inclined, and drink to excess, will
make him “as drunk as a lord”!</p>

<p class='c016'>But he may indulge in a less dangerous, and more
delicate drink, also furnished by his favorite itá. This
he obtains by flinging a few of the nuts into a vessel
of water, and leaving them awhile to ferment; then
beating them with a pestle, until the scales and pulp
are detached; and, lastly, passing the water through a
sieve of palm-fibre. This done, the drink is ready to be
quaffed. For all these purposes tools and utensils are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>required, but the itá also furnishes them. The trunk
can be scooped out into dishes; or cut into spoons,
ladles, and trenchers. The flower “spathe” also gives
him cups and saucers. Iron tools, such as hatchets and
knives, he has obtained from commerce with Europeans;
but, before their arrival in the New World, the Guaraon
had his hatchet of flint, and his knife-blade of obsidian;
and even now, if necessary, he could manage without
metal of any kind.</p>

<p class='c016'>The bow and arrows which he uses are obtained from
the tough, sinewy petiole of the leaf; so is the harpoon-spear
with which he strikes the great manatee, the porpoise,
and the alligator; the canoe, light as cork, which
carries him through the intricate channels of the delta,
is the hollow trunk of a morichi palm. His nets and
lines, and the cloth which he wears around his loins,
are all plaited or woven from the young leaflets before
they have expanded into the fan-like leaf.</p>

<p class='c016'>Like other beings, the Guaraon must at times sleep.
Where does he stretch his body,—on the floor?—on a
mat? No. He has already provided himself with a
more luxurious couch,—the “rede,” or hammock, which
he suspends between two trees; and in this he reclines,
not only during the night, but by day, when the sun is
too hot to admit of violent exertion. His wife has
woven the hammock most ingeniously. She has cut off
the column of young leaves, that projects above the
crown of the morichi. This she has shaken, until the
tender leaflets become detached from each other and
fall apart. Each she now strips of its outer covering,—a
thin, ribbon-like pellicle of a pale-yellow color,—which
shrivels up almost like a thread. These she ties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>into bundles, leaving them to dry awhile; after which
she spins them into strings, or, if need be, twists them
into larger cords. She then places two horizontal rods
or poles about six feet apart, and doubles the string over
them some forty or fifty times. This constitutes the
<i>woof</i>; and the <i>warp</i> is obtained by cross-strings twisted
or tied to each of the longitudinal ones, at intervals of
seven or eight inches. A strong cord, made from the
epidermis of the full-grown leaves, is now passed through
the loop of all the strings, drawn together at both ends,
and the poles are then pulled out. The hammock, being
finished and hung up between two trees, provides the
naked Indian with a couch, upon which he may repose
as luxuriantly as a monarch on his bed of down. Thus,
then, does a single tree furnish everything which man,
in his primitive simplicity, may require. No wonder
that the enthusiastic missionaries have given to the
morichi-palm the designation of “arbol de vida” (tree
of life).</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be asked why does the Guaraon live in such a
strange fashion,—especially when on all sides around
him there are vast tracts of <i>terra firma</i> upon which he
might make his dwelling, and where he could, with far
less difficulty, procure all the necessaries, and many of
the  luxuries of life? The question is easily answered;
and this answer will be best given by asking others in
return. Why do the Esquimaux and Laplanders cling
to their inhospitable home upon the icy coasts of the
Arctic Sea? Why do tribes of men take to the cold,
barren mountains, and dwell there, within sight of lovely
and fertile plains? Why do others betake themselves
to the arid steppes and dreary recesses of the desert?</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>No doubt the Guaraon, by powerful enemies forced
from his aboriginal home upon the firm soil, first sought
refuge in the marshy flats where we now encounter him;
there he found security from pursuit and oppression;
there—even at the expense of other luxuries—he
was enabled to enjoy the sweetest of all,—the luxury
of liberty.</p>

<p class='c016'>What was only a necessity at first, soon became a
habit; and that habit is now an essential part of his
nature. Indeed, it is not so long since the necessity
itself has been removed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Even at the present hour, the Guaraon would not be
secure, were he to stray too far from his sheltering
marshes,—for, sad though it be to say so, the poor
Indian, when beyond the protection of his tribe, is in
many parts of South America still treated as a slave.
In the <i>delta</i> he feels secure. No slave-hunter,—no
enemy can follow him there. Even the foeman of his
own race cannot compete with him in crossing the wide
flats of spongy quagmire,—over which, from long habit,
he is enabled to glide with the lightness and fleetness of
a bird. During the season of overflow, or when the
waters have fallen to their lowest, he is equally secure
from aggression or pursuit; and, no doubt, in spite of
missionary zeal,—in spite of the general progress of
civilization,—in this savage security he will long remain.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>
  <h2 class='c013'>THE LAPLANDERS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>One of the oldest “odd” people with which we are
acquainted are the Laps or Laplanders. For many centuries
the more civilized nations of Europe have listened
to strange accounts, told by travellers of these strange
people; many of these accounts being exaggerated, and
others totally untrue. Some of the old travellers, being
misled by the deer-skin dresses worn by the Laps, believed,
or endeavored to make others believe, that they
were born with hairy skins like wild beasts; and one
traveller represented that they had only a single eye,
and that in the middle of the breast! This very absurd
conception about a one-eyed people gained credit, even
so late as the time of Sir Walter Raleigh,—with this
difference, that the locality of these gentry with the odd
“optic” was South America instead of Northern Europe.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the case of the poor Laplander, not the slightest
exaggeration is needed to render him an interesting
study, either to the student of ethnology, or to the
merely curious reader. He needs neither the odd eye
nor the hairy pelt. In his personal appearance, dress,
dwelling, mode of occupation, and subsistence, he is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>different from almost every other tribe or nation of people,
as to furnish ample matter for a monograph at once
unique and amusing.</p>

<p class='c016'>I shall not stay to inquire whence originated this odd
specimen of humanity. Such speculations are more
suited to those so-called <i>learned</i> ethnologists, who, resembling
the anatomists in other branches of natural
history, delight to deal in the mere pedantry of science,—who,
from the mere coincidence of a few words, can
prove that two peoples utterly unlike have sprung from
a common source: precisely as Monsieur Cuvier, by the
examination of a single tooth, has proved that a rabbit
was a rhinoceros!</p>

<p class='c016'>I shall not, therefore, waste time in this way, in hunting
up the origin of the miserable Laplander; nor does
it matter much where he sprang from. He either came
from somewhere else, or was created in Lapland,—one
of the two; and I defy all the philosophers in creation
to say which: since there is no account extant of when
he first arrived in that cold northern land,—not a word
to contradict the idea of his having been there since the
first creation of the human race. We find him there
<i>now</i>; and that is all that we have to do with his origin
at present. Were we to speculate, as to what races are
kindred to him, and to which he bears the greatest resemblance,
we should say that he was of either the same
or similar origin with the Esquimaux of North America,
the Greenlanders of Greenland, and the Samoeids, Tuski,
and other tribes dwelling along the northern shores of
Asia. Among all these nations of little men, there is a
very great similarity, both in personal appearance and
habits of life; but it would not be safe to say that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>all came from one common stock. The resemblances
may be the result of a similarity in the circumstances,
by which they are surrounded. As for language,—so
much relied upon by the <i>scientific</i> ethnologist,—there
could scarce be a more unreliable guide. The black
negro of Carolina, the fair blue-eyed Saxon, and the
red-skinned, red-polled Hibernian, all speak one language;
the descendants of all three, thousands of years
hence, will speak the same,—perhaps when they are
widely scattered apart,—and the superficial philosopher
of those future times will, no doubt, ascribe to them all
one common origin!</p>

<p class='c016'>Language, of itself, is no <i>proof</i> of the natural affinities
of two peoples. It is evidence of their once having been
in juxtaposition,—not much more. Of course when
other points correspond, similarity of speech becomes a
valuable corroboration. It is not our purpose, then, to
inquire whence the Laplander came,—only <i>where</i> he
is now, and <i>what</i> he is how. Where is he now?</p>

<p class='c016'>If you take your map of Europe, and draw a line from
the Gulf of Kandalax, in the White Sea, to the middle
of the Loffoden Isles, on the Norwegian coast, you will
cut off the country which is now properly called Lapland.
The country at present inhabited by the people called
Laplanders, will be found north of this line. It is a
boundary more imaginary than real: for in truth there
is no political division known as Lapland, nor has there
been for hundreds of years. It is said there once was
a kingdom of Lapland, and a nation of Laplanders; but
there is no proof that either one or the other ever existed.
There was a peculiar people, whom we now style Laplanders,
scattered over the whole northern part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Scandinavian peninsula, and wandering as far south as
the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia; but, that this people
had ever any general compact, or union, deserving the
name of government or nation, there is no proof. There
is no evidence that they ever enjoyed a higher degree of
civilization than they do at present; and that is not one
iota higher than exists among the Esquimaux of North
America,—notwithstanding the advantage which the
Laplander has in the domestication of a ruminating
quadruped and a knowledge of the Christian religion.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tract of country which I have above assigned to
the modern Laplander, is to be regarded rather as meaning
that portion of Northern Europe, which can scarcely
be said to be in the occupation of any other people.
True Laplanders may be found dwelling, or rather wandering,
much to the south of the line here indicated,—almost
to the head of the Bothnian Gulf,—but in these
southern districts, he no longer has the range clear to
himself. The Finn—a creature of a very different
kind—here meets him; constantly encroaching as a
<i>colonist</i> on that territory which once belonged to the
Laplander alone.</p>

<p class='c016'>It becomes necessary to say a few words about the
names we are using: since a perfect chaos of confusion
has arisen among travellers and writers, in relation to
the nomenclature of these two people,—the Finns and
the Laplanders.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the first place, then, there is in reality no such a
people as Laplanders in Northern Europe. The word
is a mere geographical invention, or “synonyme,” if you
wish. The people to whom we apply the name, call
themselves “<i>Samlash</i>;” the Danes and Norwegians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>term them “<i>Finns</i>;” and the Swedes and Russians
style them “<i>Laps</i>.” The people whom <i>we</i> know as
Finns—and who are not Laplanders in any sense—have
received the appellation of Finns erroneously.
These Finns have for a long period been making progress,
as colonists, in the territory once occupied by the
true Finns, or Laplanders; and have nothing in common
with these last people. They are agriculturists,
and dwell in fixed settlements; not pastoral and nomadic,
as the Laplanders eminently are. Besides, there are
many other essential points of difference between the
two,—in mind,—in personal appearance, in habits, in
almost everything. I am particular upon this point,—because
the wrong application of the name <i>Finns</i>, to
this last-mentioned race, has led writers into a world of
error; and descriptions given of them and their habits
have been applied to the people who are the subjects of
the present chapter,—leading, of course, to the most
erroneous conclusions. It would be like exhibiting the
picture of a Caffre as the likeness of a Hottentot or
Bushman!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Finns, as geography now designates them,—and
which also assigns to them a country called Finland,—are,
therefore, not Finns at all. Where they are found
in the old Lapland territory as colonists, they are called
<i>Qüans</i>; and this name is given them alike by Russians,
Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians.</p>

<p class='c016'>To return to our Laplanders, who are the true Finns.
I have said that they are called by different names; by
the Danes and Norwegians “Finns,” and by the Russians
and Swedes simply “Laps.” No known meaning
is attached to either name; nor can it be discovered at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>what period either came into use. Enough to know that
these are the designations by which they are now known
to those four nations who have had chiefly to deal with
them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Since these people have received so many appellations,—and
especially one that leads to much confusion,—perhaps
it is better, for geography’s sake, to accept
the error: to leave the <i>new</i> Finns to their usurped title,
and to give the old Finns that distinctive name by
which they are best known to the world, viz. <i>Laplanders</i>.
So long as it is remembered, that this is merely a geographical
title, no harm can result from employing it;
and should the word <i>Finns</i> occur hereafter, it is to be
considered as meaning not the Finns of Norwegian
Finmark, but the Qüans of Finland, on the Gulf of
Bothnia.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have spoken of the country of the Laplanders, as
if they <i>had</i> a country. They have not. There is a
territory in which they dwell; but it is not theirs.
Long, long ago the lordship of the soil was taken from
them; and divided between three powerful neighbors.
Russia took her largest slice from the east; Sweden
fell in for its southern part; and Norway claimed that
northern and western portion, lying along the Atlantic
and Arctic Oceans. This afterwards became the property
of Denmark: when Norway herself ceased to be
independent.</p>

<p class='c016'>The country, therefore, which I have defined as Lapland,
in modern times is so styled, merely because it is
almost exclusively occupied by these people: it not
being worth the while of their Danish, Swedish, or
Russian masters to colonize it. All three, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>claim their share of it,—have their regular boundary
lines,—and each mulcts the miserable Laplander of an
annual tribute, in the shape of a small poll-tax. Each,
too, has <i>forced</i> his own peculiar views of Christianity
on those within his borders,—the Russian has shaped
the Lap into a Greek Christian; while, under Swedish
influence, he is a disciple of Martin Luther. His faith,
however, is not very rational, one way or the other;
and, in out-of-the-way corners of his chaotic country,
he still adheres to some of his old mythic customs of
sorcery and witchcraft: in other words, he is a “pagan.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Before proceeding to describe the Laplander, either
personally or intellectually, a word about the country in
which he dwells. I have called it a <i>chaotic</i> land. It
has been described as a “huge congeries of frightful
rocks and stupendous mountains, with many pleasant
valleys, watered by an infinite number of rivulets, that
run into the rivers and lakes.” Some of the lakes are
of large extent, containing a countless number of islands;
one alone—the Lake Enaro—having so many, that it
has been said no Laplander has lived long enough to
visit each particular island. There is a great variety in
the surface of the land. In some parts of the country
the eye rests only on peaks and ridges of bleak, barren
mountains,—on summits covered with never-melting
snow,—on bold, rocky cliffs or wooded slopes, where
only the firs and birches can flourish. In other parts
there are dusky forests of pines, intersected here and
there by wide morasses or bogs. Elsewhere, are extensive
tracts of treeless champaign, covered with the white
reindeer-lichen, as if they were under a fall of snow!</p>

<p class='c016'>During summer there are many green and beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>spots, where even the rose sheds its fragrance around,
and many berry-bearing bushes blossom brightly; but
the summer is of short duration, and in those parts
where it is most attractive, the pest of gnats, mosquitoes,
and gad-flies, renders the country uninhabitable to the
Laplander. We shall see presently, that, in the summer
months, he flees from such lowland scenes, as from a
pestilence; and betakes himself and his herd to the
bleak, barren mountains.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having given this short sketch of the country inhabited
by the Laplander, we proceed to a description
of himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>He is short,—not more than five feet five inches,
average height,—squat and stoutish,—rarely corpulent,—though
there is a difference in all these respects,
between those who inhabit different parts of the country.
The Laps of Norwegian Lapland are taller than those
in the Russian and Swedish territory.</p>

<p class='c016'>His features are small, his eyes elongated, or slit-like,
as among the Mongolian tribes; his cheek-bones prominent,—his
mouth large and wide, and his chin sharply
pointed. His hair is black, or sometimes brownish;
though among some tribes settled along the coasts light
hair is not uncommon. It is probable that this may
have originated in some admixture of blood with Norwegian,
Russian, and other fishermen who frequent
these coasts.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Laplander has little or no beard; and in this
respect he resembles the Greenlander and Esquimaux.
His body is ill made, bony and muscular, and stronger
than would be expected from his pigmy stature. He
is active, and capable of enduring extreme fatigue and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>privation; though it is a mistake to suppose that he is
the agile creature he has been represented,—this error
arising no doubt from the surprising speed with which
habit has enabled him to skate over the frozen snow;
and which, to a person unused to it, would appear to
prove an extraordinary degree of agility. The hands
and feet are small,—another point in common with the
Esquimaux. The Laplander’s voice is far from being a
manly one. On the contrary, it is of small compass,
weak, and of a squeaking tone. The complexion of the
Laplander is generally regarded as <i>dark</i>. Its natural
hue is perhaps not much darker than that of the Norwegian.
Certainly not darker than many Portuguese
or Spaniards; but, as he is seen, he appears as swarth
as an Indian. This, however, arises from the long and
almost constant exposure to smoke: in the midst of
which the miserable creature spends more than half
of his time.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may again be observed, that those dwelling on the
sea-shore are of lighter complexion; but perhaps that
is also due to a foreign admixture.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have given a picture of the Laplander’s person;
now a word or two about his mind.</p>

<p class='c016'>Both his intellectual and moral man are peculiar,—even
more so than his physical,—differing essentially
from that of all the other nationalities with which he is
brought in contact. He is cold-hearted, selfish, and
morose. To love he is almost a stranger; and when
such a feeling does exist within his bosom, it is rather as
a spark than a passion. His courtship and marriage are
pure matters of business,—rarely having any other
motive than self-interest. One woman will do for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>wife as well as another; and better, if she be richer
by half a dozen reindeer!</p>

<p class='c016'>Hospitality is a virtue equally unknown to him. He
wishes to see no stranger; and even wonders why a
stranger should stray into his wild, bleak country. He
is ever suspicious of the traveller through his land;
unless that traveller chance to come in the guise of a
Russian or Norwegian merchant, to exchange strong
brandy for his reindeer-skins, or the furs of the animals
he may have trapped. In his dealings he exhibits a
sufficient degree of cunning,—much more than might
be expected from the low standard of his intellect; and
he will take no paper-money or any kind of “scrip” in
exchange. This caution, however, he has acquired
from a terrible experience, which he once had in dealing
with paper-money; and he is determined that the folly
shall never again be repeated. Even in <i>his</i> out-of-the
way corner of the globe, there was at one time a bank
speculation of the “Anglo-Bengalee” character, of
which the poor Lap was made an especial victim.</p>

<p class='c016'>He has no courage whatever. He will not resist
oppression. The stranger—Russ or Norwegian—may
strike, kick, or cuff him,—he will not return the blow.
Belike he will burst into tears!</p>

<p class='c016'>And yet, under some circumstances, he shows a feeling
akin to courage. He is cool in moments of danger
from the elements, or when opposed to fierce animals, as
the wolf or the bear. He is also capable of enduring
fatigue to an extreme degree; and it is known historically
that he was once warlike,—at least much more
so than at present. <i>Now</i>, there is not a drop of warrior
blood in his veins. On the contrary, he is timid and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>pacific, and rarely quarrels. He carries constantly upon
his person a long ugly knife, of Norwegian manufacture;
but he has never been known to draw it,—never known
to commit murder with it.</p>

<p class='c016'>These are certainly virtues; but it is to be feared that
with him they owe their origin to timidity and the dread
of consequences. Now and then he has a quarrel with
one of his fellows; but the knife is never used; and the
“punishment” consists in giving and receiving various
kicks, scratches, pullings of the hair and ears: genuine
blows, however, are not attempted, and the long knife
never leaves its sheath.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the olden time he was a great believer in witches;
in fact, noted for his faith in sorcery. Christianity, such
as it is, has done much to eradicate this belief; but he is
still troubled with a host of superstitions.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of filial and parental affection his stock is but scanty.
The son shifts for himself, as soon as he is able to do so;
and but little anxiety is exhibited about him afterwards.
The daughter goes to the highest bidder,—to him who
is most liberal in presents of brandy to the parent. Jealousy
is little known. How could it be felt, where there
is no love?</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the worst vices of the Laplander is his fondness
for drink,—amounting almost to a passion. It is
one of his costliest, too: since he often consumes the
produce of his industry in its indulgence. His favorite
beverage is strong, bad brandy,—a staple article kept
by the traders, to exchange for the commodities which
the country affords. As these men care little for the
result, and have a far greater influence over the Laplander
than either the government officials, or the lazy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>timeserving missionaries, it is not probable that temperance
will ever be introduced among these wretched people.
Fortunately, only the coast Laplanders are at all
times subject to this influence. The mountain people
or those who dwell most of their time in the interior,
are too distant from the “tap” to be so grievously affected
by it. It is only on their short annual visits to
the merchant stations on the coast, that they fall extensively
into the jaws of this degrading vice.</p>

<p class='c016'>The dress of the Laplander is now to be described.</p>

<p class='c016'>The men wear on their heads tall caps, of a conical
form, usually of a cloth called <i>wadmal</i>, or some species
of kersey furnished by the merchants. This cap has a
tassel at top, and around the bottom is turned up several
inches,—where it is strengthened by a band of reindeer-skin,
or the fur of the otter. The coat is a loose garment
or frock: made of the skin of the reindeer, with
the hairy side out, and fastened around the waist with a
broad leathern belt.</p>

<p class='c016'>In this belt is stuck the pointed knife, and a pouch or
two, for pipe, tobacco, and spoon, are also suspended
from it. Breeches of reindeer-skin—the hide of the
young fawns—reach to the ankles; and buskins, or
rather stockings, of the same material cover the feet.
These are gartered over the ends of the breeches, in
such a way that no snow can get in; and since there
is neither shirt nor drawers worn, we have given every
article of a Laplander’s dress. No. There are the gloves,
or mittens, which must not be forgotten,—as they are
one of the things most essential to his comfort. These
are also the universal deer-hide.</p>

<p class='c016'>Simple as is this dress of the Lapland men, it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>more simple than that of the Lapland women, since both
one and the other are exactly alike. A slight difference
is observable in the shape of the bonnet; but for the
rest, the lady wears the deer-skin frock, the breeches,
and boots,—and like her liege lord, she scorns to include
linen in her wardrobe. This plain dress, however,
is the every-day <i>winter</i> costume. The summer one, and
especially upon grand occasions, is somewhat different,
and altogether gayer. The shape is much the same;
but the tunic or frock is of cloth, sometimes plain, coarse
<i>wadmal</i>; but in the case of the richer proprietors, of
fine colored cloth,—even scarlet being sometimes worn.
No matter what the quality of the cloth, however, the
trimmings are always of rich, bright-colored stuffs; and
consist of bands or cords around the skirt, sleeves, and
collar, elaborately stitched by the females,—who are in
all cases the tailors. The leathern belt, worn with this
dress, is loaded with ornaments,—little square and triangular
plates of brass or white metal, and often of
heavy, solid silver. The belt is an esteemed article,—as
much so as his wampum to a North-American savage,—and
it requires a large sum to tempt a Laplander to
part with the precious equipment. A finer cap is also
worn, on these summer and holiday occasions. Not
unfrequently, however, the Laplander—especially the
mountain Lap—sticks to his deer-skin coat, the <i>paesk</i>,
through all weathers, and throughout all seasons,—when
it is too hot simply taking off the belt, and leaving the
flaps loose and open. In cold weather, and especially
when riding in his sledge, an additional garment is worn.
This is a fur “tippet,” which covers his shoulders down
to the elbows. It is made from the shaggy skin of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>brown bear,—with the claws left on and hanging down
in front of the breast.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before proceeding to describe the mode of life and
occupation of the Laplander, it is necessary to state that
all of the people known as Laplanders, are not occupied
alike. On the contrary, they may be separated into
three distinct classes, according to the lives which they
lead; and it is absolutely necessary to make this classification
in the illustration of their habits. They are all
alike in race and national characteristics,—all Laplanders,—and
they differ but little in their style of dressing;
but, in other respects, what might be said of one
would not be true of the other two. I proceed, therefore,
to point out the distinction.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first to be noticed are those we have already
mentioned under the title of “Coast,” or “Shore Laplanders.”
The name will give an idea of their <i>habitat</i>,—as
also their mode of life and subsistence. They
dwell along the Norwegian coasts, round to the North
Cape, and even beyond it. They build their <i>gammes</i>,
or sod-thatched dwellings, in little villages around the
numerous creeks and “fiords” that intersect this rock-bound
shore.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their calling is that of fishermen. They subsist
almost entirely upon fish; and live by selling their surplus
to the merchants and Russian traders. They keep
a few sheep, sometimes a poor cow, but rarely own the
reindeer. The life they lead is entirely different from
that of their kindred, who dwell habitually in the interior.
As it differs little from that of poor fishermen
elsewhere, I shall dismiss the coast Laplander without
another word.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>The second kind of Lap who merits our consideration,
is that known as the “Wood Laplander,” or, more
commonly, “Wood Lap.” He is less known than either
of the two other varieties; but, as already stated, he
differs from them principally on account of his occupation.
His home is to be found upon the extensive plain
country of Russian Lapland, and not near the sea. He
is a dweller in the pine and fir-forests; and builds him
a rude hut, very similar to the gamme of the coast Lap;
but he is in possession of some reindeer,—not enough,
however, to support him,—and he ekes out a subsistence
by fishing in the rivers and fresh-water lakes of
the interior, by shooting the elk and wild reindeer,
and trapping the fur-bearing animals,—the ermine, the
sable, the miniver-squirrel, the badger, glutton, foxes,
and wolves.</p>

<p class='c016'>As his calling is chiefly that of a hunter and trapper,
and therefore very similar to like occupations in many
other parts of the world, we need not enter into details
of it here. For the present, therefore, we must <i>shelve</i>
the <i>Wood Lap</i> along with his kinsman of the coast.</p>

<p class='c016'>This brings us to the third class,—the “Mountain,”
or, as he is often called, the “Reindeer Laplander:”
since it is the possession of this animal that chiefly distinguishes
him from the other two classes of his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c016'>His mode of life is altogether different from either,—in
fact, resembling theirs in but few particulars. True,
he fishes a little, and occasionally does a bit of amateur
hunting; but these are mere adjuncts or pastimes. His
main support is his antlered flock: it would be more
truthful to call it his <i>sole</i> support. By the reindeer he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>lives, by the reindeer he <i>moves</i>, by the reindeer he has
his being.</p>

<p class='c016'>His life is purely pastoral; he is a nomade,—a wanderer.
All the world knows this; but all the world
does not know <i>why</i> he wanders. Writers have asserted
that it was to seek new pasture for his flocks,—the old
ground having been eaten bare. Nothing of the sort.
He leaves the fertile plains, just as the willows are
putting forth their succulent shoots,—just as the rich
grass begins to spring fresh and green,—and betakes
himself to the bleak sides of the mountains. That does
not look like seeking for a better pasture. It has nothing
to do with it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Let us follow him, however, throughout his wanderings,—through
the circuit of a single year,—and, perhaps,
we shall find out the motive that inducts him into
the roving habit.</p>

<p class='c016'>First, then, to be a “Reindeer Laplander,” he must
be the owner of one hundred head of deer; fewer than
that will be of no use. If he have only fifty, he must
sell out, and betake himself to some settlement of Qüans
or Norwegians,—there to give his service for hire,—or
else turn Coast Laplander and fisherman,—a calling
which he despises. This would be a sinking in the
social scale; but, if he has been imprudent or unfortunate,
and his flock has got reduced to fifty head, there
is no help for it. If he have one hundred, however, he
may manage with great economy to rub on; and keep
up his character as a <i>free Reindeer Lap</i>. With three
hundred he can live comfortably; better with five hundred;
but a thousand would render him affluent. With
fifteen hundred he would be a grandee, and two thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>would give him the rank of a millionaire! There
are very few millionaires in Lapland, and not many
grandees. Proprietors of even a thousand head are
scarce; there are more whose herds number from three
hundred to five hundred each.</p>

<p class='c016'>And here, I may remark, that there is no government,—no
tribal organization. The owner of each
herd is the head of a family; over them he is patriarch,
but his power extends no further. It is not even
great so far, if there chance to be grown-up unruly
sons sharing the common tent.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have used the word tent. That is the Reindeer
Laplander’s home,—winter and summer alike. Notwithstanding
the severity of his clime, he builds no
house; and even his tent is of the very rudest kind
known among tenting tribes. It consists of some birch
saplings set up in the snow, bent towards each other,
and then covered over with a piece of coarse cloth,—the
<i>wadmal</i>. This he prefers to a covering of skins;
and obtains it from the Norwegian or Russ trader in
exchange for the latter. The tent, when standing, is
only six feet high, and not much more in diameter. In
this circumscribed space his whole family, wife, daughters,
sons, often a retainer or two, and about a dozen
dogs find shelter from the piercing blast,—seated, or
lying beside, or on top of one another, higgledy-piggledy,
any way they can. There is room found besides for a
large iron or brass cooking-pot, some dishes and bowls
of birch, a rude stone furnace, and a fire in the middle
of the floor. Above the fire, a rack forms a shelf for
countless tough cheeses, pieces of reindeers’ flesh, bowls
of milk, bladders of deer’s blood, and a multiplicity ofi
like objects.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>The spring is just opening; the frost has thawed
from the trees,—for the winter home is in the midst
of a forest,—the ground is bare of snow, and already
smiling with a carpet of green, enamelled by many
brilliant flowers. It is time, therefore, for the Reindeer
Laplander to decamp from the spot, and seek some other
scene less inviting to the eye. You will naturally inquire
why he does this? and perhaps you will express
some surprise at a man showing so little judgment as to
take leave of the fertile plain,—just now promising to
yield him a rich pasture for his herds,—and transport
his whole stock to the cold declivity of a bleak mountain?
Yes, it is natural this should astonish you,—not,
however, when you have heard the explanation.</p>

<p class='c016'>Were he to stay in that plain—in that wood where
he has wintered—a month longer, he would run the
risk of losing half of his precious herd: perhaps in
one season find himself reduced to the necessity of becoming
a <i>Coast Lap</i>. The reason is simple,—the great
gad-fly (<i>Æstrus tarandi</i>), with numerous other tormentors,
are about to spring forth from the morass; and,
as soon as the hot sun has blown them into full strength
and vitality, commence their work of desolation upon
the deer. In a few short days or hours their eggs would
be deposited in the skin,—even in the nostrils of the
antlered creature,—there to germinate and produce
disease and death. Indeed, the torment of biting gnats
and other insects would of itself materially injure the
health and condition of the animals; and if not driven
to the mountains, they would “stampede,” and go there
of their own accord. It becomes a necessity, then,
for the Reindeer Lap to remove his habitation; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>having gathered a few necessary utensils, and packed
them on his stoutest bucks, he is off to the mountains.</p>

<p class='c016'>He does not take the whole of his <i>penates</i> along with
him. That would be difficult, for the snow is now gone,
and he cannot use his proper mode of travelling,—the
sledge. This he leaves behind him; as well as all other
implements and articles of household use, which he can
do without in his summer quarters. The cooking-pot,
and a few bowls and dishes, go along with him,—also
the tent-cloth, and some skins for bedding. The smaller
articles are deposited in panniers of wicker, which are
slung over the backs of a number of pack-deer; and, if
a balance be required, the infant Lap, in its little boat-like
cradle, forms the adjusting medium.</p>

<p class='c016'>The journey is often of immense length. There may
be highlands near, but these are not to the Laplander’s
liking. Nothing will satisfy him but the bold mountain-range
that overlooks the sea, trending along the whole
Norwegian coast: only on the declivities of this, or on
one of the thousand elevated rocky isles that guard this
extensive seaboard, does the Laplander believe that his
deer will enjoy proper health. He has a belief, moreover,
that at least once every year, the reindeer should
drink sea-water to keep them in condition. Certain it
is, that on reaching the sea, these animals rush eagerly
into the water, and drink the briny fluid; and yet ever
after, during the same season, they refuse to taste it! It
is the general opinion that the solitary draught thus
taken has the effect of destroying such larvæ, as may
have already formed in their skins.</p>

<p class='c016'>This journey often costs the Laplander great fatigue
and trouble. It is not uncommon for him to go two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>hundred miles to the Norwegian coast; for although the
habitual home may lie much nearer to the shores of the
Bothnian gulf, it would not serve his purpose to take his
flock there. The forest on that side grows to the water’s
edge; and the gadfly is as abundant there, as in the
wooded districts of the interior.</p>

<p class='c016'>On reaching his destination, the Laplander chooses
his grazing-ground, sometimes on the mountains of the
mainland; but he prefers one of the elevated islets so
numerous along the shore. This insures him against all
danger from the flies, and also saves him much trouble
in herding his deer. The islet may be two miles from
the main, or any other land. That does not signify.
The reindeer can swim like ducks, and the herd is soon
driven over. The wadmal tent is then pitched, and the
work of the summer begins. This consists in milking,
cheese-making, and looking after the young deer; and a
little fishing adds to the keep of the family: for it is at
this time that foreign support is most required. The
season of summer is with the mountain Lap his season
of scarcity! He does not dream of killing his deer at
this season,—that would be sheer waste,—nor does he
drink their milk, only in very little quantity. It goes to
the making of cheese, and the owner of the herd contents
himself with the whey. Butter is not made at all
by the Reindeer Lap, though the Qüans and Norwegians
make some. The Lap would have no use for it,—since
he eats no bread,—and it would not keep so well, nor
yet be so safe an article of merchandise as the cheese.
The latter he regards as his staple article of profit. He
sells it to the coast-merchant: receiving in exchange his
favorite dram-stuff, and a few pieces of coarse cloth, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>utensils. The merchant is near at hand: for just for
this very purpose are several small ports and settlements
kept in existence along the otherwise desert shores of
Norway. Deer-skins and dried fish, oils of the seal,
furs and pelts of various kinds, have drawn these little
settlements to the coast. Otherwise they would not be
there.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the heat of the summer is over, the reindeer
Laplander commences his return to his winter abode,—back
to the place whence he came. The gadflies are
now gone, and he can drive his deer back with safety;
and just as he travelled to the coast, he wends his way
home again: for it is to be observed that he regards the
winter residence as the real home, and the summer one
only as a place of temporary sojourn. He does not look
upon it, as we at such a season. To him it is no pleasant
excursion: rather is it his period of toil and dearth,—his
<i>tightest</i> time.</p>

<p class='c016'>Once home again, he has nothing to do but erect his
wadmal tent and look after his deer,—that now find
food upon their favorite lichen. It is buried inches deep
under the snow. They care not for that. They can soon
uncover the pasture with their broad hoofs; and their
keen scent never allows them to scrape up the snow
without finding the lichen underneath. Upon it they
thrive, and at this season are in the best condition for
the knife.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Laplander now also enjoys life. If rich, he has
fresh venison every day; but even if only moderately
well off, he “kills” two or three times a week. His
mode of slaughtering is original. He sticks his long
knife-blade into the throat of the animal, leaving it there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>till the creature is dead! This precaution he takes to
prevent waste. Were he to pull out the blade, the blood
would flow and be lost. The knife acts as a stopper to
the wound it has made. The blood is preserved and
carefully put away,—the bladder being used as the
vessel to contain it.</p>

<p class='c016'>You must not imagine that the Reindeer Lap remains
all the winter in one place; on the contrary, he moves
repeatedly, always taking his tent and tent-utensils along
with him. The tent is as easily set up as taken down.
The ground in all sheltered places is, at this season, covered
with snow. It is only necessary to shovel it off,
clearing a circular space about the size of the ground-plan
of the tent. The snow, thus removed, produces a
sort of elevated ring or snow-dyke all round the bare
spot; and into this the tent-poles are hammered. They
are then bent inward, tied near the tops, and the <i>wadmal</i>
being laid on as before, the tent is ready for use.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fresh branches of evergreen pines, and other trees,
are strewed over the floor; and on top of these are laid
the deer-skins that serve for beds, chairs, tables, and
blankets. These, with the iron cooking-pot, a large iron
or brass pail to hold melted snow-water for drinking,
and a few other utensils, are the only furniture of the
dwelling. I have already stated that the fire is built in
the centre of the tent,—on some large stones, forming
a rudely-constructed hearth. A hole in the roof is intended
for a chimney; but its draught is so bad, that the
tent is almost always filled with a cloud of bitter smoke,—so
thick as to render objects invisible. In this atmosphere
no other European, excepting a Lap, could
possibly exist; and travellers, passing through the Lapland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>country, have often preferred braving the cold frost
of the night air, to being half smothered by the smoke:
and have consequently taken shelter under a neighboring
tree. The Laplander himself feels but little inconvenienced
by the very thickest smoke.</p>

<p class='c016'>Habit is everything, and to this habit has he been
used from his infancy. His eyes, however, are not so
indifferent to the annoyance. These suffer from it; and
the consequence is that the eyes of the Laplanders are
almost universally sore and watery. This is a notable
characteristic of the race. Smoke, however, is not the
sole cause of it. The Esquimaux equally suffer from
sore eyes; and these, burning oil in their houses instead
of wood, are seldom troubled with smoke. More likely
it is the snow-glare to which the Laplander, as well as
the Esquimaux, is much exposed, that brings about this
copious <i>watering</i> of the eyes.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Laplander cooks the reindeer flesh by boiling.
A large piece is put into the great family pot, and nothing
added but a quantity of water. In this the meat
boils and simmers till it is done tender. The oily fat
is then skimmed off, and put into a separate vessel; and
the meat is “dished” in a large tray or bowl of birch-bark</p>

<p class='c016'>A piece is then cut off, for each individual of the
family; and handed around the circle. It is eaten without
bread, and even salt is dispensed with. A dip in
the bowl of skim-fat is all the seasoning it gets; and it
is washed down with the “liquor” in which it has been
boiled, and which is nothing but greasy water, without
vegetables or any other “lining.” It has the flavor of
the fat venison, however; and is by no means ill-tasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>The <i>angelica</i> flourishes in the country of the Laplander,
and of this vegetable he makes occasional use, not eating
the roots, but the stalks and leaves, usually raw and
without any preparation. Perhaps he is led to use it,
by a knowledge of the antiscorbutic properties of the
plant.</p>

<p class='c016'>Several species of berry-producing bushes also furnish
him with an occasional meal of fruit. There are wild
currants, the cranberry, whortle, and bilberries. The
fruits of these trees do not fall in the autumn, as with
us; but remain all winter upon the branches. Buried
under the snow, they are preserved in perfect condition,
until the thaw of the following spring once more brings
them into view. At this time they are sweet and mellow;
and are gathered in large quantities by the Lap
women. Sometimes they are eaten, as they come from
the tree; but it is more usual to make them into a
“plum-pudding:” that is, they are mixed with a kind
of curdled milk, and stored away in bladders. When
wanted, a slice is cut from the mass,—including a piece
of the bladder, within which they have now attained to
the stiffness and consistence of a “cream-cheese.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Another great luxury of the Laplander, is the reindeer’s
milk frozen into an “ice.” This is easily obtained;
and the process consists simply in filling a birchen
bowl with milk, and exposing it to the open air
during frost. It is soon converted into solid ice; and
in this condition will keep perfectly sweet throughout
the whole of the winter. As the reindeer are never
milked in the depth of the winter season, the Laplander
takes care, before that period approaches, to lay in a
stock of ice-milk: so that he may have a drink of it at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>all times, by simply setting one of his birchen bowls
within reach of the fire. He even makes a merchandise
of this article: for the frozen reindeer milk is highly
prized by the foreign merchants; who are ready, at any
time, to exchange for the delicious article a dram of
their devilish fire-water.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is at this season that the Laplander moves about
both on foot and in his sledge. He not only travels
from place to place, in a circuit of twenty miles,—round
the little solitary church which the Swedish missionary
has built for him,—but he makes an occasional
journey to the distant coast.</p>

<p class='c016'>In his sledge, or even afoot, a hundred miles are to
him as nothing: for the frozen snow enables him to perform
such a distance in an incredibly short time. On
his “skies,” or snow-skates he could do a hundred miles
in a couple of days; even though the paths led him over
hills, mountains, lakes, and rivers. All are now alike,—all
concealed under the common covering of a deep
snow. The lakes and rivers are frozen and bridged for
him; and the mountain declivities are rendered smooth
and easily traversed,—either by the sledge or the
“skies.” With the former he would think little of a
hundred miles in a single day; and if the occasion were
a “killing” one, and relays could be had upon the route,
twice that enormous distance he could easily accomplish.</p>

<p class='c016'>The mode of sleigh-travelling by the Reindeer Laplander,
as also his snow-skimming, or skating, have been
both often and elaborately described. I have only space
here to present the more salient points of the picture.</p>

<p class='c016'>This sleigh or sledge is termed by him “pulka;” but
he has three varieties of this article,—two for travelling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>and the third for carrying luggage. The two first
kinds are nearly alike; and, in fact, differ only in a little
extra “furniture,” which one of them has upon it,—that
is, a covering over the top, to keep more comfortable the
feet and legs of the traveller. In other respects it is
only the common pulk, being similar to the latter in
shape, size, <i>atelage</i>, and everything.</p>

<p class='c016'>To get an idea of the Laplander’s sledge, you must
fancy a little boat, about six feet long, and sixteen inches
in breadth of beam. This is the width at the stern,
where it is broadest; but from the stern it narrows all
the way forward, until, on reaching the stem, it has
tapered almost to a point. Its sides are exactly like
those of a boat; and it rests upon a “keel” of about
four inches breadth, which keel is the one and only
“runner.” A strong board boxes up the stern end, in
front of which is the seat; and the board itself serves
to support the back of the rider. His legs and feet are
stretched out longitudinally; filling up the space between
the quarter-deck and the “for’ard” part of the
little craft; and, thus fixed, the Laplander is ready for
the road.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the best class of “pulk”—that used by the Russ
and Swedish traders and travellers—the forward part
is covered with a sort of half-deck of skins or leather;
but the Laplander does not often fancy this. It gives
him too much trouble to get out and in; as he is often
compelled to do to look after his train of deer. His
pulk, therefore, is open from stem to stern; and his
deer-skin coverings keep his legs warm enough.</p>

<p class='c016'>Only one deer is used; and the mode of harnessing
is of primitive simplicity. A band of skin acts as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>collar round the neck of the animal; and from the lowest
point of this a piece falls downwards below the
animal’s breast,—striking in on the counter like the
pendants of a martingale. To this piece is attached
the trace,—there is but one,—which, passing between
the forelegs, and afterwards the hind ones, is looped
into an iron ring upon the stem of the sledge. Upon
this trace, which is a strong strap of raw hide or
leather, the whole draught-power is exerted. A broad
surcingle—usually of cloth, neatly stitched and ornamented—passes
round the deer’s body. Its use is to
hold up the trace underneath the belly, and prevent it
from dragging the ground, or getting among the animal’s
feet. A similar band of cloth passes round its neck,
giving a fine appearance to the noble creature. A single
rein attached to the left horn, or fixed halter-fashion
around the deer’s head, is all that is necessary to guide
it along; the movements of this, aided by the accents
of its master’s voice, are understood by this well-trained
animal.</p>

<p class='c016'>For all that, the deer does not <i>always</i> travel kindly.
Frequently he takes a fit of obstinacy or anger; and
will then turn upon his trainer,—presenting his antlered
front in an attitude of attack. On such occasions
the Lap takes shelter behind his “pulk,” raising it in
his arms, and holding it as a shield wherewith to defend
himself; until he can pacify, or otherwise subdue, the
irritated buck.</p>

<p class='c016'>The tumbling of the sledge, and consequent spilling
of its load, is a thing of frequent occurrence, owing to
the narrow base upon which the vehicle is supported,
but the Laplander thinks nothing of a trifling mishap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>of this nature. In a trice the “snow-boat” is righted,
the voyager in his seat again, and off over the frozen
snow with the speed of lightning.</p>

<p class='c016'>The reindeer can travel nearly twenty English miles
an hour! This rate of speed has been proved and
tested; and with fresh relays along the route, over four
hundred miles might be made in a day. But the same
thing could be done with horses,—that is, upon a
desperate emergency.</p>

<p class='c016'>The luggage “pulk” of the Laplander differs only
from the other kinds of sledges in being longer, broader,
deeper, and consequently of more capacity to carry
goods. It is used for transporting the skins and other
merchantable commodities, from the interior to the trading
depots on the coast.</p>

<p class='c016'>The <i>skies</i> or snow-skates require very little description.
They are on the same principle as the snow-shoes
in use among the North-American Indians, though from
these they differ materially in construction. They are
merely two long pieces of smooth board, a few inches
in breadth, and slightly turned up at the ends. One is
full six feet,—the right one; the left is about twelve inches
shorter. Near the middle they are lashed firmly
to the feet by strong pieces of hide; and by means of
these curious appendages, when the snow is crusted
over, the Laplander can skim over its surface with great
rapidity. He uses a long pole to guide and assist him
in his movements; and this pole has a piece of circular
board, or a round ball, near its point,—to prevent it
from sinking too deeply in the snow. Going <i>up hill</i>
upon the skies is not so easy; but the practised skater
can ascend even the steep acclivities of the mountains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>with less difficulty than might be imagined. This is
accomplished in zigzag lines,—each leading to a higher
elevation. Down hill, the course upon <i>skies</i> is rapid
almost as the flight of an arrow; and, by means of the
long pole, rocks, ravines, and precipices, are shunned
with a dexterity that is quite surprising. Altogether a
Laplander, either in his reindeer sledge, or upon his
long wooden “skies,” is as interesting a sight as may
be seen anywhere.</p>

<p class='c016'>After all that has been said, it will appear pretty
clearly, that the Laplander, though dwelling so very
near to civilized lands, is still very far distant from
<i>true civilization</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE ANDAMANERS, OR MUD-BEDAUBERS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>On the eastern side of the Bay of Bengal lies a
cluster, or archipelago, of islands known as the “Andamans.”
They form a long string running nearly northward
and southward; and with the Nicobar group, still
further to the south, they appear like a series of stepping-stones
connecting Cape Negrais, in the Burmese
country, with the island of Sumatra. Independent of
the Nicobar Islands, the Andamans themselves have an
extent of several hundred miles in length; while their
breadth is nowhere over about twenty miles. Until of
late the greater portion of the group was supposed to
form only one island,—known as the “Great Andaman;”
but, in the year 1792, this was discovered to
have a channel across it that divided it into two distinct
parts.</p>

<p class='c016'>The discovery of this channel was accidental; and the
accident was attended with melancholy consequences.
A vessel from Madras had entered between the Great
Andaman, and the opposite coast of Burmah. This
vessel was laden with provisions, intended for the supply
of Port Cornwallis,—a convict settlement, which
the British had formed the preceding year on the eastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>side of the island. The master of the vessel, not
knowing the position of Port Cornwallis, sent a boat to
explore an opening which he saw in the land,—fancying
that it might be the entrance to the harbor. It was
not this, however; but the mouth of the channel above
mentioned. The crew of the boat consisted of two Europeans
and six Lascars. It was late in the afternoon
when they stood into the entrance; and, as it soon fell
dark upon them, they lost their way, and found themselves
carried along by a rapid current that set towards
the Bay of Bengal. The northeast monsoon was blowing
at the time with great violence; and this, together
with the rapid current, soon carried the boat through the
channel; and, in spite of their efforts, they were driven
out into the Indian Ocean, far beyond sight of land.
Here for eighteen days the unfortunate crew were buffeted
about; until they were picked up by a French
ship, almost under the equinoctial line, many hundreds
of miles from the channel they had thus involuntarily
discovered! The sad part of the story remains to be
told. When relieved by the French vessel, the two
Europeans and three of the Lascars were still living;
the other three Lascars had disappeared. Shocking to
relate, they had been killed and eaten by their companions!</p>

<p class='c016'>The convict settlement above mentioned was carried
on only for a few years, and then abandoned,—in consequence
of the unhealthiness of the climate, by which
the Sepoy guards of the establishment perished in great
numbers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding this, the Andaman Islands present a
very attractive aspect. A ridge of mountains runs nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>throughout their whole extent, rising in some places
to a height of between two and three thousand feet.
These mountains are covered to their tops by dense
forests, that might be called primeval,—since no trace
of clearing or cultivation is to be found on the whole
surface of the islands; nor has any ever existed within
the memory of man, excepting that of the convict settlement
referred to. Some of the forest trees are of great
size and height; and numerous species are intermixed.
Mangroves line the shores; and prickly ferns and wild
rattans form an impenetrable brake on the sides of the
hills; bamboos are also common, and the “gambier”
or “cutch” tree (<i>Agathis</i>), from which is extracted the
Terra Japonica of commerce. There are others that
yield dyes, and a curious species of screw-pine (<i>pandanus</i>),—known
as the “Nicobar bread-fruit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding their favorable situation, the zoölogy
of these islands is extremely limited in species. The
only quadrupeds known to exist upon them are wild
hogs, dogs, and rats; and a variety of the monkey tribe
inhabits the forests of the interior. The land-birds are
few,—consisting of pigeons, doves, small parrots, and the
Indian crow; while hawks are seen occasionally hovering
over the trees; and a species of humming-bird flies
about at night, uttering a soft cry that resembles the
cooing of doves. There are owls of several species;
and the cliffs that front the coast are frequented by a
singular swallow,—the <i>hirundo esculenta</i>, whose nests
are eaten by the wealthy mandarins of China. Along
the shores there are gulls, kingfishers, and other aquatic
birds. A large lizard of the <i>guana</i> species is common,
with several others; and a green snake, of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>venomous description, renders it dangerous to penetrate
the jungle thickets that cover the whole surface of the
country.</p>

<p class='c016'>In all these matters there is not much that is remarkable,—if
we accept the extreme paucity of the zoölogy;
and this is really a peculiarity,—considering that the
Andaman Islands lie within less than eighty leagues of
the Burman territory, a country so rich in mammalia;
considering, too, that they are covered with immense
forests, almost impenetrable to human beings, on account
of their thick intertwining of underwood and parasitical
plants,—the very home, one would suppose for wild
beasts of many kinds! And withal we find only three
species of quadrupeds, and these small ones, thinly distributed
along the skirts of the forest. In truth, the
Andaman Islands and their <i>fauna</i> have long been a
puzzle to the zoölogist.</p>

<p class='c016'>But longer still, and to a far greater extent, have their
human inhabitants perplexed the ethnologist; and here
we arrive at the true peculiarity of the Andaman Islands,—that
is to say, the <i>people</i> who inhabit them. With
perhaps no exception, these people are the most truly
savage of any on the face of the globe; and this has
been their character from the earliest times: for they
have been known to the ancients as far back as the time
of Ptolemy. Ptolemy mentions them under the title of
<i>anthropophagi</i> (man-eaters); and the Arabs of the ninth
century, who navigated the Indian Ocean, have given a
similar account of them. Marco Polo adopts this statement,
and what is still more surprising, one of the most
noted ethnologists of our own time—Dr. Latham—has
given way to a like credulity, and puts the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>Andamaners down as “pagan cannibals.” It is an error;
they are not cannibals in any sense of the word; and if
they have ever eaten human flesh,—of which there is
no proof,—it has been when impelled by famine. Under
like circumstances, some of every nation on earth
have done the same,—Englishmen, Germans, Frenchmen,
Americans,—of late years frequently,—in the
mountains of New Mexico and California.</p>

<p class='c016'>The charge of cannibalism against these miserable beings
rests on no other foundation than the allegations of
Chinese sailors, and the vague statements of Ptolemy
and the Arabs above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Chinese have occasion now and then to visit the
Andaman Islands in their junks, to collect the edible
nests of the swallow (<i>hirundo esculenta</i>),—which birds
have extensive breeding-places on the cliffs that overhang
the coast of the Great Andaman. The “trepang,”
or sea-slug, is also found in large quantities upon the
rocks near the shore; and this is equally an object of
commerce, and esteemed an article of the greatest luxury,
among the mandarins, and other rich celestials who
can afford to indulge in it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Now and then, a junk has been wrecked among these
rocks; and its miserable crew have fallen a victim to
the hostility of the natives: just as they might have
done on more civilized coasts, where no cannibalism was
ever suspected to exist. Crews of junks have been totally
destroyed,—murdered, if you please,—but it
would not be difficult to show, that this was done more
from motives of revenge than from a mere sanguinary instinct
or disposition; but there is no proof whatever of
even a single case, of true cannibalism. Indeed, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>are strong reasons for our disbelief in this horrid, custom,—so
far as regards the poor savages of the Andamans.
An incident, that seems to give a flat contradiction to it
occurred during the occupancy of the island by the East-India
Company in the year 1793; and other proofs of
non-cannibalism have been obtained at a still more recent
period, to which we shall presently allude.</p>

<p class='c016'>The incident of 1793 was as follows: A party of
fishers belonging to the settlement enticed an Andaman
woman to come near, by holding out presents of food.
The woman was made captive by these treacherous men;
who, instead of relieving her hunger, proceeded to behave
to her in the most brutal and unfeeling manner.
The cries of the poor creature brought a numerous troop
of her people to the spot; who, rushing out of the thickets
from every side, collected around the fishermen; and,
having attacked them with spears and arrows, succeeded
in killing two of their number. The rest with difficulty
escaped to the settlement; and, having obtained assistance,
a large party set out to search for the bodies of
their companions. There was but little expectation that
these would be recovered: as all were under the belief
that the savages must have carried them away for the
purpose of making a cannibal feast upon them. There
had been ample time for the removing of them: since
the scene of the struggle was at a considerable distance
from the fort.</p>

<p class='c016'>The searchers, therefore, were somewhat astonished
it finding both bodies on the spot where they had fall
in, and the enemy entirely gone from the ground! The
bodies were disfigured in the most shocking manner.
The flesh was pierced in every part,—by spears, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>doubt,—and the bones had been pounded with heavy
stones, until they were mashed into fragments; but not
a bit of flesh was removed, not even an arm or limb had
been severed!</p>

<p class='c016'>The other instance to which we have promised to
allude occurred at a much more recent period,—so
late, in fact, as the period of the King of Delhi’s imprisonment.
It will be fresh in the memory of my
readers, that his Hindoo majesty was carried to the
island of Great Andaman, along with a number of “Sepoy”
rebels, who had been taken prisoners during the
late Indian revolt. The convict settlement was restored,
especially for this purpose; and a detachment of “East-India
Company’s troops” was sent along with the rebel
sepoys to guard them. It was supposed that the troops
would have great difficulty in the performance of their
duty: since the number of their prisoners was larger
than could be fairly looked after; and, it was well
known, that, if a prisoner could once get clear of the
walls of the fort, it would be altogether idle to pursue
him. The chase after a fugitive through the tangled
forests of the Andamans would be emphatically a “wild-goose”
chase; and there would be ten chances to one
against his being recaptured.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such, in reality, did it appear, for the first week or
two, after the settlement was re-established. Numerous
prisoners escaped into the woods, and as it was deemed
idle to follow them, they were given up as “lost birds.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In the end, however, it proved that they were not all
lost,—though some of them were. After a week or
two had expired, they began to straggle back to the fort,
and voluntarily deliver themselves up to their old guards,—now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>one, now another, or two or three at a time,—but
all of them in the most forlorn and deplorable condition.
They had enjoyed a little liberty on the Andaman
isles; but a taste of it had proved sufficient to satisfy
them that captivity in a well-rationed guard-house
was ever preferable to freedom with a hungry stomach,
added to the risk which they ran every hour of the day
of being impaled upon the spears of the savages. Many
of them actually met with this fate; and others only
escaped half dead from the hostile treatment they had
received at the hands of the islanders. There was no
account, however, that any of them had been <i>eaten</i>,—no
evidence that their implacable enemies were cannibals.</p>

<p class='c016'>Such are a few arguments that seem to controvert the
accusation of Ptolemy and the two Arab merchants,—in
whose travels the statement is found, and afterwards
copied by the famous Marco Polo. Probably the Arabs
obtained their idea from Ptolemy, Marco Polo from the
Arabs, and Dr. Latham from Marco Polo. Indeed, it is
by no means certain that Ptolemy meant the Andaman
Islands by his <i>Islæ bonæ Fortunæ</i>, or “Good-luck Isles,”—certainly
a most inappropriate appellation. He may
have referred to Sumatra and its Battas,—who <i>are</i>
cannibals beyond a doubt. And, after all, what could
Ptolemy know about the matter except from vague report,
or, more likely still, more vague <i>speculation</i>,—a
process of reasoning practised in Ptolemy’s time, just as
at the present day. We are too ready to adopt the
errors of the ancient writers,—as if men were more
infallible then than they are now; and, on the other
hand, we are equally prone to incredulity,—often rejecting
their testimony when it would conduct to truth.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>I believe there is no historic testimony—ancient or
modern—before us, to prove that the Andaman islanders
are cannibals; and yet, with all the testimony to the
contrary, there is one fact, or rather a hypothesis, which
shall be presently adduced, that would point to the <i>probability</i>
of their being so.</p>

<p class='c016'>If they are not cannibals, however, they are not the
less unmitigated <i>savages</i>, of the very lowest grade and
degree. They are unacquainted with almost the very
humblest arts of social life; and are not even so far
advanced in the scale as to have an organization. In
this respect they are upon a par with the Bushmen of
Africa and the Diggers of North America: still more
do they resemble the wretched starvelings of Tierra del
Fuego. They have no tribal tie; but dwell in scattered
groups or gangs,—just as monkeys or other animals
of a gregarious nature.</p>

<p class='c016'>In person, the Andaman is one of the very “ugliest”
of known savages. He is of short stature, attaining to
the height of only five feet; and his wife is a head
shorter than himself. Both are as black as pitch, could
their natural color be discovered; but the skin is usually
hidden under a mask of rare material, which we shall
presently have occasion to describe.</p>

<p class='c016'>The upper half of the Andamaner’s body is strongly
and compactly built, and his arms are muscular enough.
It is below, in the limbs, where he is most lacking in
development. His legs are osseous and thin; and, only
when he is in fine condition, is there the slightest swell
on them that would indicate the presence of a calf. His
feet are of monstrous length, and without any symmetry,—the
heel projecting far backwards, in the fashion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>usually styled “lark-heeled.” It is just possible that a
good deal of practice, by running over mud-banks and
quicksands in search of his shell-fish subsistence, may
have added to the natural development of his pedal extremities;
for there can be no longer any doubt, that
like effects have been produced by such causes,—effects
that are indeed, after all, more <i>natural</i> than <i>artificial</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Andamaner exhibits the protuberance of belly
noticed among other savages, who lead a starving life;
and his countenance is usually marked with an expression
that betrays a mixture of ferocity and famine.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is worthy of remark, however, that though these
stunted proportions are generally observable among the
natives of the Andaman Islands, they do not appear to
be universal. It is chiefly on the island of the Great
Andaman that the most wretched of these savages are
found. The Little Andaman seems to produce a better
breed: since parties have been met with on this last-named
island, in which many individuals were observed
nearly six feet in height, and stout in proportion. One
of these parties, and the incident of meeting with it,
are thus described by an officer who was present:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“We had not gone far, when, at an angle of the
jungle, which covers the island to within a few yards
of the water’s edge, we came suddenly upon a party of
the natives, lying upon their bellies behind the bushes,
armed with spears, arrows, and long-bows, which they
bent at us in a threatening manner. Our Lascars, as
soon as they saw them, fell back in great consternation,
levelling their muskets and running into the sea towards
the boats. It was with great difficulty we could prevent
our cowardly rascals from firing; the tyndal was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>only one who stood by the chief mate and myself. We
advanced within a few paces of the natives, and made
signs of drinking, to intimate the purpose of our visit.
The tyndal salaamed to them, according to the different
oriental modes of salutation,—he spoke to them in
Malay, and other languages; but they returned no
answer, and continued in their crouching attitude, pointing
their weapons at us whenever we turned. I held
out my handkerchief, but they would not come from behind
the bushes to take it. I placed it upon the ground;
and we returned, in order to allow them an opportunity
of picking it up: still they would not move.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I counted sixteen strong and able-bodied men opposite
to us, many of them very lusty; and further on,
six more. They were very different in appearance from
what the natives of the Great Andaman are represented
to be,—that is, of a puny race. The whole party was
completely naked, with the exception of one,—a stout
man nearly six feet in height, who was standing up
along with two or three women in the rear. He wore
on his head a red cloth with white spots.</p>

<p class='c016'>“They were the most ferocious and wild-looking beings
I ever beheld. Those parts of their bodies that
were not besmeared with mud, were of a sooty black
color. Their faces seemed to be painted with a red
ochre.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding the difference in stature and other
respects,—the result no doubt of a better condition of
existence,—the inhabitants of both islands, Great and
Little Andaman, are the same race of people; and in
the portrait, the faces of both may be considered as one
and the same. This brings us to the strangest fact in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>whole history of the Andaman islander. Instead
of a Hindoo face, or a Chinese Mongolian face, or that
of a Malay,—any of which we might reasonably expect
to find in an aboriginal of the Bay of Bengal,—we
trace in the Andaman islander the true physiognomy
of a negro. Not only have we the flat nose and thick
lips, but the curly hair, the sooty complexion, and all
the other negro characteristics. And the most ill-favored
variety at that; for, in addition to the ungraceful
features already mentioned, we find a head large beyond
all proportion, and a pair of small, red eyes deeply
sunken in their sockets. Truly the Andaman islander
has few pretensions to being a beauty!</p>

<p class='c016'>Wretched, however, as the Andaman islander may
appear, and of little importance as he certainly is in the
great social family of the human race, he is, ethnologically
speaking, one of its most interesting varieties.
From the earliest times he has been a subject of speculation,
or rather his presence in that particular part of
the world where he is now found: for, since it is the
general belief that he is entirely isolated from the two
acknowledged negro races, and surrounded by other
types of the human family, far different from either,
the wonder is how he came to be there.</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps no other two thousand people on earth—for
that is about the number of Andaman islanders—have
been honored with a greater amount of speculation
in regard to their origin. Some ethnologists assign to
them an African origin, and account for their presence
upon the Andaman Islands by a singular story: that a
Portuguese ship laden with African slaves, and proceeding
to the Indian colonies, was wrecked in the Bay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>of Bengal, and, of course, off the coast of the Andamans
that the crew were murdered by the slaves; who, set
free by this circumstance, became the inhabitants of the
island. This story is supported by the argument, that
the hostility which the natives now so notoriously exhibit,
had its origin in a spirit of revenge: that still
remembering the cruel treatment received on the “middle
passage” at the hands of their Portuguese masters,
they have resolved never to be enslaved again; but to
retaliate upon the white man, whenever he may fall into
their power!</p>

<p class='c016'>Certainly the circumstances would seem to give some
color to the tale, if it had any foundation; but it has
none. Were we to credit it, it would be necessary to
throw Ptolemy and the Arab merchants overboard, and
Marco Polo to boot. All these have recorded the existence
of the Andaman islanders, long before ever a
Portuguese keel cleft the waters of the Indian Ocean,—long
even before Di Gama doubled the Cape!</p>

<p class='c016'>But without either the aid of Ptolemy or the testimony
of the Arabian explorers, it can be established
that the Andaman Islands were inhabited before the era
of the Portuguese in India; and by the same race of
savages as now dwell upon them.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another theory is: that it was an <i>Arabian</i> slave-ship
that was wrecked, and not a Portuguese; and this would
place the peopling of the islands at a much earlier period.
There is no positive fact, however, to support
this theory,—which, like the other, rests only on mere
speculation.</p>

<p class='c016'>The error of these hypotheses lies in their mistaken
<i>data</i>; for, although we have stated that the Andaman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>islanders are undoubtedly a negro race, they are not that
negro race to which the speculation points,—in other
words, they are not <i>African</i> negroes. Beyond certain
marked features, as the flat nose and thick lips, they
have nothing in common with these last. Their hair is
more of the kind called “frizzly,” than of the “woolly”
texture of that of the Ethiopian negro; and in this respect
they assimilate closely to the “Papuan,” or New
Guinea “negrillo,” which every one knows is a very
different being from the <i>African</i> negro.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their moral characteristics—such as there has been
an opportunity of observing among them—are also an
additional proof that they are not of African origin;
while these point unmistakably to a kinship with the
other side of the Indian Ocean. Even some of their
fashions, as we shall presently have occasion to notice,
have a like tendency to confirm the belief that the Andaman
is a “negrillo,” and not a “negro.” The only
obstacle to this belief has hitherto been the fact of their
isolated situation: since it is alleged—rather hastily
as we shall see—that the whole of the opposite continent
of the Burmese and other empires, is peopled by
races entirely distinct: that none of the adjacent islands—the
Nicobars and Sumatra—have any negro or negrillo
inhabitants: and that the Andamaners are thus cut off, as
it were, from any possible line of migration which they
could have followed in entering the Bay of Bengal.
Ethnologists, however, seem to have overlooked the circumstance
that this allegation is not strictly true. The
<i>Samangs</i>—a tribe inhabiting the mountainous parts of
the Maylayan peninsula—are also a negro or negrillo
race; a fact which at once establishes a link in the chain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>of a supposed migration from the great Indian archipelago.</p>

<p class='c016'>This lets the Andaman islander into the Great China
Sea; or rather, coming from that sea, it forms the stepping-stone
to his present residence in the Bay of Bengal.
Who can say that he was not at one time the
owner of the Maylayan peninsula? How can we account
for the strange fact, that figures of Boodh—the Guadma
of the Burmese and Siamese—are often seen in
India beyond the Ganges, delineated with the curly hair
and other characteristic features of the negro?</p>

<p class='c016'>The theory that the Samang and Andaman islander
once ruled the Malay peninsula; that they themselves
came from eastward,—from the great islands of the
Melanesian group, the centre and source of the negrillo
race,—will in some measure account for this singular
monumental testimony. The probability, moreover, is
always in favor of a migration <i>westward within the
tropics</i>. Beyond the tropics, the rule is sometimes reversed.</p>

<p class='c016'>A coincidence of personal habit, between the Andaman
islander and the Melanesian, is also observed. The
former dyes his head of a brown or reddish color,—the
very fashion of the Feegee!</p>

<p class='c016'>Suppose, then, that the Samang and Andaman islander
came down the trades, at a period too remote for even
tradition to deal with it: suppose they occupied the Malay
peninsula, no matter how long; and that at a much
more recent period, they were pushed out of place,—the
one returning to the Andaman Islands, the other to
the mountains of the Quedah: suppose also that the
party pushing them off were Malays,—who had themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>been drifted for hundreds of years down the trades
from the far shores of America (for this is <i>our</i> “speculation”):
suppose all these circumstances to have taken
place, and you will be able to account for two facts that
have for a long time puzzled the ethnologist. One is
the presence of negroes on the islands of Andaman,—and
the other of Malays in the southeastern corner of
Asia. We might bring forward many arguments to uphold
the probability of these hypotheses, had we space
and time. Both, however, compel us to return to the
more particular subject of our sketch; and we shall do
so after having made a remark, promised above, and
which relates to the <i>probability</i> of the Andaman islander
being a cannibal. This, then, <i>would lie in the fact of
his being a Papuan negro</i>. And yet, again, it is only a
seeming; for it might be shown that with the Papuan
cannibalism is not a natural instinct. It is only where
he has reached a high degree of <i>civilization</i>, as in the
case of the Feegee islander. Call the latter a monster
if you will; but, as may be learnt from our account of
him, he is anything but a <i>savage</i>, in the usual acceptation
of the term. In fact, language has no epithet sufficiently
vile to characterize such an anomalous animal
as he.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have endeavored to clear the Andaman islander of
the charge of this guilt; and, since appearances are so
much against him, he ought to feel grateful. It is doubtful
whether he would, should this fall into his hands, and
he be able to read it. The portrait of his face without
that stain upon it, he might regard as ugly enough; and
that of his habits, which now follows, is not much more
flattering.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>His house is little better than the den of a wild beast,
and far inferior in ingenuity of construction to those
which beavers build. A few poles stuck in the ground
are leant towards each other, and tied together at the
top. Over these a wattle of reeds and rattan-leaves
forms the roof; and on the floor a “shake-down” of
withered leaves makes his bed, or, perhaps it should
rather be called his “lair.” This, it will be perceived,
is just the house built by Diggers, Bushmen, and Fuegians.
There are no culinary utensils,—only a drinking-cup
of the <i>nautilus</i> shell; but implements of war and
the chase in plenty: for such are found even amongst
the lowest of savages. They consist of bows, arrows,
and a species of javelin or dart. The bows are very
long, and made of the bamboo cane,—as are also the
darts. The arrows are usually pointed with the tusks
of the small wild hogs which inhabit the islands. These
they occasionally capture in the chase, hanging up the
skulls in their huts as trophies and ornaments. With
strings of the hog’s teeth also they sometimes ornament
their bodies; but they are not very vain in this respect.
Sometimes pieces of iron are found among them,—nails
flattened to form the blades of knives, or to make an
edge for their adzes, the heads of which are of hard
wood. These pieces of iron they have no doubt obtained
from wrecked vessels, or in the occasional intercourse
which they have had with the convict establishment;
but there is no regular commerce with them,—in
fact, no commerce whatever,—as even the Malay
traders, that go everywhere, do not visit the Andamaners,
from dread of their well-known Ishmaelitish character.
Some of the communities, more forward in civilization,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>possess articles of more ingenious construction,—such
as baskets to hold fruits and shell-fish, well-made
bows, and arrows with several heads, for shooting fish.
The only other article they possess of their own manufacture,
is a rude kind of canoe, hollowed out of the
trunk of a tree, by means of fire and their poor adze.
A bamboo raft, of still ruder structure, enables them
to cross the narrow bays and creeks by which their coast
is indented.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their habitual dwelling-place is upon the shore. They
rarely penetrate the thick forests of the interior, where
there is nothing to tempt them: for the wild hog, to
which they sometimes give chase, is found only along
the coasts where the forest is thinner and more straggling,
or among the mangrove-bushes,—on the fruits of
which these animals feed. Strange to say, the forest,
though luxuriant in species, affords but few trees that
bear edible fruits. The cocoa-palm—abundant in all
other parts of the East-Indian territories, and even upon
the Cocos Islands, that lie a little north of the Andamans—does
not grow upon these mountain islands.
Since the savages know nothing of cultivation, of course
their dependence upon a vegetable diet would be exceedingly
precarious. A few fruits and roots are eaten
by them. The pandanus, above mentioned, bears a fine
cone-shaped fruit, often weighing between thirty and
forty pounds; and this, under the name of <i>mellori</i>, or
“Nicobar bread-fruit,” forms part of their food. But it
requires a process of cooking, which, being quite unknown
to the Andamaners, must make it to them a
“bitter fruit” even when roasted in the ashes of their
fires, which is their mode of preparing it. They eat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>also the fruit of the mangrove, and of some other trees,
but these are not obtainable at all seasons, or in such
quantity as to afford them a subsistence. They depend
principally upon fish, which they broil in a primitive
manner over a gridiron of bamboos, sometimes not waiting
till they are half done. They especially subsist
upon shell-fish, several kinds abounding on their coasts,
which they obtain among the rocks after the tide has
gone out. To gather these is the work of the women,
while the men employ themselves in fishing or in the
chase of the wild hog. The species of shell-fish most
common are the <i>murex tribulus</i>, <i>trochus telescopium</i>,
<i>cypræa caurica</i>, and muscles. They are dexterous in
capturing other fish with their darts, which they strike
down upon the finny prey, either from their rafts, or by
wading up to their knees in the water. They also take
fish by torchlight,—that is, by kindling dry grass, the
blaze of which attracts certain species into the shallow
water, where the fishers stand in wait for them.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the fishery fails them, and the oysters and muscles
become scarce, they are often driven to sad extremities,
and will then eat anything that will sustain life,—lizards,
insects, worms,—perhaps even <i>human flesh</i>.
They are not unfrequently in such straits; and instances
are recorded, where they have been found lying upon
the shore in the last stages of starvation.</p>

<p class='c016'>An instance of this kind is related in connection with
the convict settlement of 1793. A coasting-party one
day discovered two Andamaners lying upon the beach.
They were at first believed to be dead, but as it proved,
they were only debilitated from hunger: being then in
the very last stages of famine. They were an old man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>and a boy; and having been carried at once to the fort,
every means that humanity could suggest was used to
recover them. With the boy this result was accomplished;
but the old man could not be restored: his
strength was too far gone; and he died, shortly after
being brought to the settlement.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two women or young girls were also found far gone
with hunger; so far, that a piece of fish held out was
sufficient to allure them into the presence of a boat’s
crew that had landed on the shore. They were taken on
board the ship, and treated with the utmost humanity.
In a short time they got rid of all fears of violence being
offered them; but seemed, at the same time, to be sensible
of modesty to a great degree. They had a small apartment
allotted to them; and though they could hardly have
had any real cause for apprehension, yet it was remarked
that the two never went to sleep at the same time:
one always kept watch while the other slept! When
time made them more familiar with the good intentions
towards them, they became exceedingly cheerful, chattered
with freedom, and were amused above all things
at the sight of their own persons in a mirror. They
allowed clothes to be put on them; but took them off
again, whenever they thought they were not watched,
and threw them away as a useless encumbrance! They
were fond of singing; sometimes in a melancholy recitative,
and sometimes in a lively key; and they often
gave exhibitions of dancing around the deck, in the
fashion peculiar to the Andamans. They would not
drink either wine or any spirituous liquor; but were
immoderately fond of fish and sugar. They also ate
rice when it was offered to them. They remained, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>rather were retained, several weeks on board the ship
and had become so smooth and plump, under the liberal
diet they indulged in, that they were scarce recognizable
as the half-starved creatures that had been brought
aboard so recently. It was evident, however, that they
were not contented. Liberty, even with starvation allied
to it, appeared sweeter to them than captivity in the
midst of luxury and ease. The result proved that this
sentiment was no stranger to them: for one night, when
all but the watchman were asleep, they stole silently
through the captain’s cabin, jumped out of the stern
windows into the sea, and swam to an island full half a
mile distant from the ship! It was thought idle to pursue
them; but, indeed, there was no intention of doing
so. The object was to retain them by kindness, and try
what effect might thus be produced on their wild companions,
when they should return to them. Strange to
say, this mode of dealing with the Andaman islanders
has been made repeatedly, and always with the same
fruitless result. Whatever may have been the original
cause that interrupted their intercourse with the rest
of mankind, they seem determined that this intercourse
shall never be renewed.</p>

<p class='c016'>When plenty reigns among them, and there has been
a good take of fish, they act like other starved wretches
and yield themselves up to feasting and gorging, till not
a morsel remains. At such times they give way to excessive
mirth,—dancing for hours together, and chattering
all the while like as many apes.</p>

<p class='c016'>They are extremely fond of “tripping it on the light
fantastic toe;” and their dance is peculiar. It is carried
on by the dancers forming a ring, and leaping about,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>each at intervals saluting his own posteriors with a slap
from his foot,—a feat which both the men and women
perform with great dexterity. Not unfrequently this mode
of salutation is passed from one to the other, around
the whole ring,—causing unbounded merriment among
the spectators.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their fashion of dress is, perhaps, the most peculiar
of all known costumes. As to clothing, they care nothing
about it,—the females only wearing a sort of narrow
fringe around the waist,—not from motives of
modesty, but simply as an ornament; and in this scant
garment we have a resemblance to the <i>liku</i> of the
Feegeeans. It can hardly be said, however, that either
men or women go entirely naked; for each morning,
after rising from his couch of leaves, the Andamaner
plasters the whole of his body with a thick coat of
mud, which he wears throughout the day. Wherever
this cracks from getting dry by the sun, the place is
patched or mended up with a fresh layer. The black
mop upon his head is not permitted to wear its natural
hue; but, as already mentioned, is colored by means
of a red ochreous earth, which is found in plenty upon
the islands. This reddening of his poll is the only
attempt which the Andamaner makes at personal adornment;
for his livery of mud is assumed for a purpose
of utility,—to protect his body from the numerous
mosquitoes, and other biting insects, whose myriads infest
the lowland coast upon which he dwells.</p>

<p class='c016'>A startling peculiarity of these islanders is the unmitigated
hostility which they exhibit, and have always
exhibited, towards every people with whom they have
come in contact. It is not the white man alone whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>they hate and harass; but they also murder the Malay,
whose skin is almost as dark as their own. This would
seem to contradict the hypothesis of a tradition of hostility
preserved amongst them, and directed against white
men who enslaved their ancestors; but, indeed, that
story has been sufficiently refuted. A far more probable
cause of their universal hatred is, that, at some period
of their history, they have been grossly abused; so
much so as to render suspicion and treachery almost
an instinct of their nature.</p>

<p class='c016'>In these very characteristic moral features we find
another of those striking analogies that would seem to
connect them with the negrillo races of the Eastern
Archipelago; but, whether they are or are not connected
with them, their appearance upon the Andamans is no
greater mystery, than the solitary “fox-wolf” on the
Falkland Islands, or the smallest wingless insect in
some lone islet of the Ocean?</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE PATAGONIAN GIANTS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>Who has not heard of the <i>giants</i> of Patagonia?
From the days of Magellan, when they were first seen,
many a tale has been told, and many a speculation indulged
in about these colossal men: some representing
them as very Titans, of twelve feet in height, and stout
in proportion: that, when standing a little astride, an
ordinary-sized man could pass between their legs without
even stooping his head! So talked the early navigators
of the Great South Sea.</p>

<p class='c016'>Since the time when these people were first seen by
Europeans, up to the present hour,—in all, three hundred
and thirty years ago,—it is astonishing how little
has been added to our knowledge of them; the more so,
that almost every voyager who has since passed through
the Straits of Magellan, has had some intercourse with
them;—the more so, that Spanish people have had settlements
on the confines of their country; and one—an
unsuccessful one, however—in the very heart of
it! But these Spanish settlements have all decayed, or
are fast decaying; and when the Spanish race disappears
from America,—which sooner or later it will
most certainly do,—it will leave behind it a greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>paucity of monumental record, than perhaps any civilized
nation ever before transmitted to posterity.</p>

<p class='c016'>Little, however, as we have learnt about the customs
of the Patagonian people, we have at least obtained a
more definite idea of their height. <i>They have been measured.</i>
The twelve-feet giants can no longer be found;
they never existed, except in the fertile imaginations of
some of the old <i>navigators</i>,—whose embodied testimony,
nevertheless, it is difficult to disbelieve. Other
and more reliable witnesses have done away with the
Titans; but still we are unable to reduce the stature of
the Patagonians to that of ordinary men. If not actual
<i>giants</i>, they are, at all events, very tall men,—many
of them standing seven feet in their boots of guanaco-leather,
few less than six, and a like few rising nearly to
eight! These measurements are definite and certain;
and although the whole number of the Indians that inhabit
the plains of Patagonia may not reach the above
standard there are tribes of smaller men called by the
common name Patagonians,—yet many individuals certainly
exist who come up to it.</p>

<p class='c016'>If not positive giants, then, it is safe enough to consider
the Patagonians as among the “tallest” of human
beings,—perhaps the very tallest that exist, or ever
existed, upon the face of the earth; and for this reason,
if for no other, they are entitled to be regarded as an
“odd people.” But they have other claims to this distinction;
for their habits and customs, although in general
corresponding to those of other tribes of American
Indians, present us with many points that are peculiar.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be remarked that the Patagonian women, although
not so tall as their men, are in the usual proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>observable between the sexes. Many of them are
more corpulent than the men; and if the latter be called
<i>giants</i>, the former have every claim to the appellation of
<i>giantesses</i>!</p>

<p class='c016'>We have observed, elsewhere, the very remarkable
difference between the two territories, lying respectively
north and south of the Magellan Straits,—the Patagonian
on the north, and the Fuegian on the south. No
two lands could exhibit a greater contrast than these,—the
former with its dry sterile treeless plains,—the latter
almost entirely without plains; and, excepting a portion
of its eastern end, without one level spot of an acre
in breadth; but a grand chaos of humid forest-clad ravines
and snow-covered mountains. Yet these two dissimilar
regions are only separated by a narrow sea-channel,—deep,
it is true; but so narrow, that a cannon-shot
may be projected from one shore to the other. Not less
dissimilar are the people who inhabit these opposite
shores; and one might fancy a strange picture of contrast
presented in the Straits of Magellan: on some
projecting bluff on the northern shore, a stalwart Patagonian,
eight feet in height, with his ample guanaco-skin
floating from his shoulders, and his long spear towering
ten feet above his head;—on the southern promontory,
the dwarfed and shrivelled figure of a Fuegian,—scarce
five feet tall,—with tiny bow and arrows in hand, and
shivering under his patch of greasy seal-skin!—and yet
so near each other, that the stentorian voice of the giant
may thunder in the ears of the dwarf; while the hen-like
cackle of the latter may even reach those of his
colossal <i>vis-à-vis</i>!</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding this proximity, there is no converse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>between them; for, unlike as are their persons, they are
not more dissimilar than their thoughts, habits, and actions.
The one is an aquatic animal, the other essentially
terrestrial; and, strange to say, in this peculiarity
the weaker creature has the advantage: since the Fuegian
can cross in his bark canoe to the territory of his
gigantic neighbor, while the latter has no canoe nor
water-craft of any kind, and therefore never thinks of
extending his excursions to the “land of fire,” excepting
at one very narrow place where he has effected a crossing.
In many other respects, more particularly detailed
elsewhere,—in their natural dispositions and modes of
life, these two peoples are equally dissimilar; and although
learned craniologists may prove from their skulls,
that both belong to one division of the human family,
this fact proves also that craniology, like anatomy, is but
a blind guide in the illustration of scientific truth,—whether
the subject be the skull of a man or an animal.
Despite all the revelations of craniologic skill, an Indian
of Patagonia bears about the same resemblance to an
Indian of Tierra del Fuego, as may be found between a
bull and a bluebottle!</p>

<p class='c016'>Before proceeding to describe the modes of life practised
by the Patagonian giants, a word or two about the
country they inhabit.</p>

<p class='c016'>It may be generally described as occupying the whole
southern part of South America,—from the frontier of
the Spanish settlements to the Straits of Magellan,—and
bounded east and west by the two great oceans.
Now, the most southern Spanish (Buenos-Ayrean) settlement
is at the mouth of Rio Negro; therefore, the
Rio Negro—which is the largest river south of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>La Plata—may be taken as the northern boundary of
Patagonia. Not that the weak, vitiated Spanish American
extends his sway from the Atlantic to the Andes:
on the contrary, the Indian aborigines, under one name
or another, are masters of the whole interior,—not only
to the north of the Rio Negro, but to the very shores of
the Caribbean Sea! Yes, the broad inland of South
America, from Cape Horn to the sea of the Antilles, is
now, as it always has been, the domain of the Red Indian;
who, so far from having ever been reduced by
conquest, has not only resisted the power of the Spanish
sword, and the blandishments of the Spanish cross; but
at this hour is encroaching, with constant and rapid
strides, upon the blood-stained territory wrested from
him by that <i>Christian conquest</i>!</p>

<p class='c016'>And this is the man who is so rapidly to disappear
from the face of the earth! If so, it is not the puny
Spaniard who is destined to push him off. If he is to
disappear, it will be at such a time, that no Spaniard will
be living to witness his extermination.</p>

<p class='c016'>Let us take Patagonia proper, then, as bordered upon
the north by the Rio Negro, and extending from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. In that case it is a country of
eight hundred miles in length, with a breadth of at least
two hundred,—a country larger than either France or
Spain. Patagonia is usually described as a continuation
of the great plains, known as the “Pampas,” which extend
from the La Plata River to the eastern slope of the
Andes. This idea is altogether erroneous. It is true
that Patagonia is a country of plains,—excepting that
portion of it occupied by the Andes, which is, of course,
a mountain tract, much of it resembling Tierra del Fuego
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>in character more than Patagonia. Indeed, Patagonia
proper can hardly be regarded as including this mountain
strip: since the Patagonian Indians only inhabit the
plains properly so called. These plains differ essentially
from those of the Pampas. The latter are based upon a
calcareous formation: and produce a rank, rich herbage,—here
of gigantic thistles and wild artichokes,—there
of tall grasses; and, still nearer the mountains, they are
thinly covered with copses of low trees. The plains of
Patagonia on the other hand, are of tertiary formation,
covered all over with a shingly pebble of porphyry and
basalt, and almost destitute of vegetation. Here and
there are some tufts of scanty grass with a few stunted
bushes in the valleys of the streams, but nothing that
can be called a tree. A surface drear and arid, in places
mottled with “salinas” or salt-lakes; with fresh water
only found at long intervals, and, when found, of scanty
supply. There are many hilly tracts, but nothing that
can be called mountains,—excepting the snow-covered
Cordilleras in the west. The Patagonian plain is not
everywhere of equal elevation: it rises by steps, as you
follow it westward, beginning from the sea-level of the
Atlantic shore; until, having reached the <i>piedmont</i> of
the Andes, you still find yourself on a plain, but one
which is elevated three thousand feet above the point
from which you started. At all elevations, however, it
presents the same sterile aspect; and you perceive that
Patagonia is a true desert,—as much so as Atacama, in
Peru, the desert of the Colorado in the north, the “barren
grounds” of Hudson’s Bay, the Sahara and Kalahari,
Gobi, or the steppe of Kaurezm. To the South-African
deserts it bears a more striking resemblance than to any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>of the others,—a resemblance heightened by the presence
of that most remarkable of birds,—the ostrich. Two
species stalk over the plains of Patagonia,—the <i>struthio
rhea</i> and <i>struthio Darwinii</i>. The former extends
northward over the Pampas, but not southward to the
Straits of Magellan; the latter reaches the Straits, but is
never seen upon the Pampas. The ranges of both meet
and overlap near the middle of the Patagonian plain.</p>

<p class='c016'>In addition to the ostrich, there are other large birds
that frequent the steppes of Patagonia. The great condor
here crosses the continent, and appears upon the
Atlantic shores. He perches upon the cliffs of the sea,—as
well as those that overhang the inland streams,—and
builds his nest upon the bare rock. Two species
of <i>polyborus</i>, or vulture-eagles,—the “carrancha” and
“chiniango,”—fly side by side with the condor; and
the black turkey-vultures are also denizens of this desert
land. The red puma, too, has his home here; the fox
of Azara; and several species of hawks and eagles.</p>

<p class='c016'>With the exception of the first-mentioned—the ostrich—all
these beasts and birds are predatory creatures;
and require flesh for their subsistence. Where
do they get it? Upon what do they all prey? Surely
not upon the ostrich: since this bird is bigger than any
of the birds of prey, and able to defend itself even
against the great condor. There are only one or two
other species of birds upon which the eagles might subsist,—a
partridge and two kinds of plover; but the
vultures could not get a living out of partridges and
plovers. Small quadrupeds are alike scarce. There are
only two or three species; and very small creatures they
are,—one a sort of mole, “terutero,” and several kinds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>of mice. The latter are, indeed, numerous enough in
some places,—swarming over the ground in tracts so
sterile, that it is difficult to understand upon what they
subsist. But vultures do not relish food, which they
require to kill for themselves. They are too indolent
for that; and wherever they are found, there must be
some source of supply,—some large quadrupeds to
provide them with their favorite food,—carrion. Otherwise,
in this desert land, how should the ravenous
puma maintain himself?—how the vultures and vulture-eagles?
and, above all, upon what does the Patagonian
himself subsist,—a man of such great bulk, as
naturally to require more than the ordinary amount of
food? The answer to all these questions, then, is, that
a quadruped <i>does</i> exist in the deserts of Patagonia;
which, if it furnish not all these creatures with their full
diet supplies, does a large proportion of it. This quadruped
is the <i>guanaco</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>Before proceeding to give an account of the guanaco,
let us paint the portrait of the Patagonian himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>As already observed, he is nearly seven feet in height,
without any exaggeration in the way of a hat. He
wears none, but suffers his long black hair to hang loosely
over his shoulders, or, more frequently, gathers it into
a knot or club upon the crown of his head. To keep it
from straggling into his eyes, he usually wears a narrow
strap of guanaco-skin around his forehead, or a plaited
band of the hair of the same animal; but, although possessing
ostrich-feathers at discretion, he rarely indulges
in the fashion of wearing a plume,—he knows he is
tall enough without one. Over his shoulders, and hanging
nearly to his heels, he wears a loose mantle of guanaco skins;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>which is of sufficient width to wrap round his
body, and meet over his breast,—should he feel cold
enough to require it. But he is not of a chilly nature;
and he often throws this mantle entirely aside to give
him the freedom of his arms; or more generally ties
a girdle round it, and leaves the upper part to fall back
from his shoulders, and hang down over the girdle. This
mantle—with the exception of a small pouch-like apron
in front—is the only “garment,” the Patagonian wears
upon his body; but his lower limbs have a covering of
their own. These are encased in a sort of boots or
moccasons,—but differing from all other boots and
moccasons, in the fact of their being without <i>soles</i>!
They are made of the same material as the mantle,—that
is, of the skin of the <i>guanaco</i>,—but sometimes
also of the skin of a horse’s shank,—for the Patagonian,
like the Pampas Indian, is in possession of this valuable
animal.</p>

<p class='c016'>This soleless boot covers the leg all round from below
the knee, passing over the top of the foot like a gaiter;
it extends also around the heel, and a little under it,
but not so far as the instep, thus leaving the greater
part of the sole bare, and the toes peeping out in front!
They are, in reality, nothing more or less than gaiters,
but gaiters of <i>guanaco</i>-skin, with the hair turned outward,
and worn, not over a pair of boots or shoes, as
gaiters usually are, but upon the naked shanks.</p>

<p class='c016'>I have been thus particular in my description of the
Patagonian <i>chaussure</i>; but you will understand my
reasons, when I tell you that, from this trifling circumstance,
not only has a vast territory of country, but the
people who inhabit it, obtained the appellation by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>both have long been known to the civilized world, that
is, <i>Patagonian</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the sailors who accompanied Magellan first
saw these colossal men, they noticed a peculiar circumstance
in relation to their feet. The flaps, or “uppers,”
of the gaiters, extending loosely across the tops
of their feet, and exaggerated in breadth by the long
hair that fringed out from their edges, gave to these
Indians the appearance of having paws or “patas;”
and the name <i>patagones</i>, or “duck-feet,” was given them
by the sailors,—ever prone to the bestowal of a ludicrous
epithet. This name, in a slightly altered form,
they have borne ever since,—so that Patagonia means
the country of the <i>duck-footed</i> men.</p>

<p class='c016'>The gaiters of the Patagonians have their peculiar
purpose. They are not worn merely for the sake of
keeping the legs warm, but also as a protection against
the thorny shrubs which in Patagonia, as in all desert
lands, are exceedingly abundant.</p>

<p class='c016'>The mantle and moccasons, then, constitute the Patagonian’s
costume; and it does not differ so widely from
that of his neighbor the Fuegian,—the chief points of
difference being in the size and material.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course the guanaco-skin is much larger than that
of the common seal; and a good Patagonian cloak
would furnish “doublets” for a whole tribe of the diminutive
Fuegians. Perhaps his ample garment has
something to do in producing the exaggerated accounts
that have been given of the stature of the Patagonians.
Certain it is, that a man thus apparelled looks larger
than he otherwise would do; and presents altogether a
more imposing appearance. The Caffre, in his civet-cat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>“kaross,” and the Pawnee Indian, in his robe of
shaggy buffalo-hide, loom very large upon karroo and
prairie,—much larger in appearance than they really
are. It is but natural, therefore, to suppose that the
Patagonian, attired in his guanaco mantle, and seen
against the sky, standing upon the summit of a conspicuous
cliff, would present a truly gigantic appearance.</p>

<p class='c016'>When first seen in this position he was on foot. It
was in the year 1520,—before the Spaniards had set
foot upon South-American soil,—and of course before
the horse became naturalized to that continent. In less
than thirty years afterward, he appeared upon these
same cliffs bestriding a steed: for this noble animal had
extended his range over the plains of America,—even
at an earlier period than his European owner. When
the Spaniards, in their after-attempts at conquering the
Indians of the Pampas and those of the northern prairies,
entered upon these great plains, they encountered,
to their great astonishment, their red enemies upon
horseback, brandishing long lances, and managing fiery
chargers with a skill equal to their own!</p>

<p class='c016'>Among the earliest tribes that obtained possession
of the horse, were those of the Pampas: since the first
of these animals that ran wild on the plains of America
were those landed in the La Plata expedition of Mendoza,—whence
they became scattered over the adjacent
pampas of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p class='c016'>From the banks of the La Plata, the horse passed
rapidly southward to the Straits of Magellan; and from
that hour the Patagonian walked no more. With the
exception of a spur,—usually a sharp stick of wood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>upon his heel,—the only additional article of his
“wear,” the horse has made no change in his costume,
nor in the fashion of his toilet. He still paints his face,
as Magellan first saw it,—with a white ring encircling
one eye, and a black or red one around the
other; with one half of his body colored black, and a
white sun delineated upon it, while the other half is
white, forming the “ground” for a black moon! Scarce
two individuals, however, wear the same escutcheon;
for the fashion of having eyes, arms, and legs of two
different colors—just as our ancestors used to wear
their doublets and hose—is that followed by the Patagonians.</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding this queer custom,—usually regarded
as savage,—it would be unjust to call the Patagonian
a <i>savage</i>. If we overlook the circumstance of his
painting himself,—which, after all, is scarce more absurd
than numberless practices of civilized life,—if we
excuse him for too scantily covering the nakedness of
his person, and relishing his food a little “underdone,”
we find little else, either in his habits or his moral
nature that would entitle him to be termed a savage.
On the contrary, from all the testimony that can be
obtained,—in all the intercourse which white men have
had with him,—there is scarce an act recorded, that
would hinder his claim to being considered as civilized
as they. Honorable and amiable, brave and generous,
he has ever proved himself; and never has he exhibited
those traits of vindictive ferocity supposed to be characteristic
of the untutored man. He has not even harbored
malice for the wrongs done him by the unprincipled
adventurer Magellan: who, in his treatment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>these people, proved himself more of a savage than
they. But the Patagonian restrained his vengeance;
and apparently burying the outrage in oblivion, has
ever since that time treated the white man with a generous
and dignified friendship. Those who have been
shipwrecked upon his solitary shores, have had no reason
to complain of the treatment they have received at his
hands. He is neither cannibal, nor yet barbarian,—but
in truth a gentleman,—or, if you prefer it, a <i>gentleman
savage</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>But how does this gentleman maintain himself? We
have already seen that he is not a fisherman,—for he
owns no species of boat; and without that his chances
of capturing fish would be slight and uncertain. We
have stated, moreover, that his country is a sterile
desert; and so it is,—producing only the scantiest of
herbage; neither plant, nor tree, that would furnish
food; and incapable of being cultivated with any success.
But he does not attempt cultivation,—he has no
knowledge of it; nor is it likely he would feel the inclination,
even if tempted by the most fertile soil. Neither
is he pastoral in his habits: he has no flocks nor
herds. The horse and dog are his only domestic animals;
and these he requires for other purposes than
food. The former enables him to pass easily over the
wide tracts of his sterile land, and both assist him in the
chase,—which is his true and only calling. One of the
chief objects of his pursuit is the ostrich; and he eats
the flesh of this fine desert bird. He eats it, whenever
he can procure it; but he could not live solely upon
such food: since he could not obtain it in sufficient
quantity; and were this bird the only means he had for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>supplying his larder, he would soon be in danger of
starvation. True, the ostrich lays a great many eggs,
and brings forth a large brood of young; but there are
a great many hungry mouths, and a great many large
stomachs among the Patagonian people. The ostrich
could never supply them all; and were it their only
resource, the bird would soon disappear from the plains
of Patagonia, and, perhaps, the race of Patagonian
giants along with it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fortunately for the Patagonian, his country furnishes
him with another kind of game, from which he obtains
a more sufficient supply; and that is the guanaco. Behold
yonder herd of stately creatures! There are
several hundreds of them in all. Their bodies are covered
with long, woolly hair of a reddish-brown color.
If they had antlers upon their heads, you might mistake
them for stags,—for they are just about the size of the
male of the red deer. But they have no horns; and
otherwise they are unlike these animals,—in their long
slender necks, and coat of woolly hair. They are not
deer of any kind,—they are <i>guanacos</i>. These, then,
are the herds of the Patagonian Indian; they are the
game he chiefly pursues; and their flesh the food, upon
which he is mainly subsisted.</p>

<p class='c016'>I need not here give the natural history of the guanaco.
Suffice it to say that it is one of the four (perhaps
five) species of <i>llamas</i> or “camel-sheep” peculiar
to the continent of South America,—the other three
of which are the <i>vicuña</i>, the true <i>llama</i>, and the <i>paco</i>,
or <i>alpaca</i>. The llama and alpaca are domesticated; but
the vicuña, the most graceful of all, exists only in a
wild state, like the guanaco. The four kinds inhabit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>table-lands of the Andes, from Colombia to Chili; but
the guanaco has extended its range across to the Atlantic
side of the continent: this only in the territory south
of the La Plata River. On the plains of Patagonia it
is the characteristic quadruped: rarely out of sight, and
usually seen in herds of twenty or thirty individuals;
but sometimes in large droves, numbering as many as
five hundred. There the puma—after the Indian of
course—is its greatest enemy,—and the <i>débris</i> of <i>his</i>
feast constitutes the food of the vultures and vulture-eagles,—thus
accounting for the presence of these great
birds in such a desert land.</p>

<p class='c016'>The guanaco is among the shyest of quadrupeds; and
its capture would be difficult to any one unacquainted
with its habits. But these betray them to the skilled
Patagonian hunter,—who is well acquainted with every
fact in the natural history of the animal.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Patagonian mode of capturing these creatures is
not without many peculiarities in hunting practice. His
first care is to find out their whereabouts: for the haunts
which the guanacos most affect are not the level plains,
where they might be seen from afar, but rather those
places where the ground is hilly or rolling. There they
are to be met with, ranged in extended lines along the
sides of the hills, with an old male keeping watch upon
the summit of some eminence that overlooks the flock.
Should the sentinel espy any danger, or even suspect it,
he gives the alarm by uttering a shrill, whistling cry,
somewhat resembling a neigh. On hearing this well-known
signal, the others at once take to flight, and
gallop straight for the side of some other hill,—where
they all halt in line, and stand waiting to see if they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>followed. Very often the first intimation which the
hunter has of their presence, is by hearing their strange
signal of flight,—which may be described as a sort
of triangular cross between squealing, neighing, and
whistling.</p>

<p class='c016'>Shy as they are, and difficult to be approached, they
have the strange peculiarity of losing all their senses
when put into confusion. On these occasions they behave
exactly like a flock of sheep: not knowing which
way to run; now dashing to one side, then to the other,
and often rushing into the very teeth of that danger
from which they are trying to escape!</p>

<p class='c016'>Knowing their stupidity in this respect, the Patagonian
hunter acts accordingly. He does not go out to
hunt the guanacos alone, but in company with others
of his tribe, the hunting-party often comprising the
whole tribe. Armed with their “chuzos,”—light cane
spears of eighteen feet in length,—and mounted on
their well-trained steeds, they sally forth from their encampment,
and proceed to the favorite pasturing-ground
of the guanacos. Their purpose is, if possible, to effect
the “surround” of a whole herd; and to accomplish
this, it is necessary to proceed with great skill and caution.
The animals are found at length; and, by means
of a deployment of dogs and horsemen, are driven
towards some hill which may be convenient to the pasture.
The instinct of the animal guiding it thither,
renders this part of the performance easy enough. On
reaching the hill, the guanacos dash onward, up to its
summit; and there, halting in a compact crowd, make
front towards their pursuers. These meanwhile have
galloped into a circle,—surrounding the eminence or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>all sides; and, advancing upwards amidst loud yells and
the yelping of their dogs, close finally around the herd,
and rush forward to the attack.</p>

<p class='c016'>The long chuzos do their work with rapidity; and,
in a few minutes, numbers of the guanacos lie lifeless
among the rocks. The dogs, with some men, form an
outer circle of assailants; and should any guanacos
escape through the line of horsemen, they are seized
upon by the dogs, and pinned to the spot,—for it is
another sheep-like trait in the character of this animal,
that the moment a dog—even though he be the merest
cur—seizes hold of it, it neither attempts further flight
nor resistence, but remains “pinned” to the spot as if
under a paralysis of terror. They sometimes give battle,
however, though never to a dog; and their mode of
assault is by kicking behind them,—not with their hoofs
as horses do, but with the knee-joints, the hind legs being
both raised at once. Among themselves the males
fight terrible battles: biting each other with their teeth,
and often inflicting cruel acerations.</p>

<p class='c016'>Strange to say, when the guanacos are found solitary,
or only two or three together, they are far less shy than
when assembled in large herds. At such times, the feeling
of curiosity seems stronger than that of fear within
them; and the hunter can easily approach within a dozen
paces of one, by simply cutting a few capers, or holding
up something that may be new to it,—such as a strip
of colored rag, or some showy article of any kind. It
was by such devices that the Patagonian captured these
creatures, before possession of the horse enabled him to
effect their destruction in the more wholesale fashion of
the “surround.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>By tumbling about over the ground, he was enabled
to bring the game within reach,—not of his bow and
arrows; nor yet of his long spear,—for he did not use
it for such a purpose,—and, of course, not of a gun, for
he never had heard of such a weapon. Within reach
of what then? Of a weapon peculiarly his own,—a
weapon of singular construction and deadly effect; which
he knew how to employ before ever the white man came
upon his shores, and which the Spaniards who dwell in
the Pampas country have found both pride and profit in
adopting. This weapon is the “bolas.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It is simple and easily described. Two round stones,—the
women make them round by grinding the one
against the other,—two round stones are covered with
a piece of guanaco raw hide, presenting very much the
appearance of cricket-balls, though of unequal size,—one
being considerably smaller than the other. Two
thongs are cut; and one end of each is firmly attached
to one of the balls.</p>

<p class='c016'>The other ends of the thongs are knotted to each
other; and when the strings are at full stretch, the balls
will then be about eight feet apart,—in other words,
each thong should be four feet in length. The bolas
are now made, and ready for use. The chief difficulty
in their manufacture lies in the rounding of the stones;
which, as above observed, is the work of the women;
and at least two days are required to grind a pair of
bola-stones to the proper spherical shape. To handle
them requires long practice; and this the Patagonian
has had: for, ever since the young giant was able to
stand upon his feet, he has been in the habit of playing
with the bolas. They have been the toy of his childhood;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>and to display skill in their management has been
the pride of his boyish days; therefore, on arriving at
full maturity, no wonder he exhibits great dexterity in
their use. He can then project them to a distance of
fifty yards,—with such precision as to strike the legs of
either man or quadruped, and with such force, that the
thong not only whips itself around the object struck, but
often leaves a deep weal in the skin and flesh. The
mode of throwing them is well known. The right hand
only is used; and this grasps the thongs at their point
of union, about half-way between the ends. The balls
are then whirled in a circular motion around the head
and, when sufficient centrifugal power has been obtained,
the weapon is launched at the object to be captured.
The aim is a matter of nice calculation,—in which arm,
eye, and mind, all bear a part,—and so true is this aim,
in Patagonian practice, that the hunter seldom fails to
bring down or otherwise cripple his game,—be it ostrich,
cavy, or guanaco.</p>

<p class='c016'>By these bolas, then, did the Patagonian hunter capture
the guanaco and ostrich in times past; and by the
same weapon does he still capture them: for he can use
it even better on horseback than on foot. Either the
bird or the quadruped, within fifty yards, has no chance
of escape from his unerring aim.</p>

<p class='c016'>The bolas, in some districts, have been improved upon
by the introduction of a third ball; but this the Patagonian
does not consider an <i>improvement</i>. Wooden balls
are sometimes employed; and iron ones, where they can
be had,—the last sort can be projected to the greatest
distance.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Patagonian takes the young guanacos alive; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>brings them up in a state of domestication. The little
creatures may often be observed, standing outside the
tents of a Patagonian encampment,—either tied by a
string, or held in hand by some “infant giant” of the
tribe. It is not solely for the pleasure of making pets
of them, that the young guanacos are thus cherished;
nor yet to raise them for food. The object aimed at
has a very different signification. These young guanacos
are intended to be used as <i>decoys</i>: for the purpose of attracting
their own relatives,—fathers, mothers, sisters,
brothers, uncles, and aunts, even to the most distant
thirty-second cousinship,—within reach of the terrible
bolas!</p>

<p class='c016'>This is effected by tying the innocent little creature
to some bush,—behind which the hunter conceals himself,—and
then imitating the mother’s call; which the
Indian hunter can do with all the skill of a ventriloquist.
The young captive responds with the plaintive cry of
captivity,—the parents are soon attracted to the spot,
and fall victims to their instinct of natural affection.
Were it not for this, and similar stratagems adopted by
the Patagonian hunter, he would pursue the guanaco in
vain. Even with the help of his pack of dogs, and
mounted upon the fleet Spanish horse, the guanaco cannot
be hunted with success. Nature, in denying to these
animals almost every means of defence, has also bestowed
upon them a gift which enables them to escape from
many kinds of danger. Of mild and inoffensive habits,—defenceless
as the hare,—they are also possessed of
a like swiftness. Indeed, there is perhaps no quadruped—not
even the antelope—can get over the ground as
speedily as the guanaco or its kindred species the vicuña,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>Both are swift as the wind; and the eye, following
either in its retreat over the level plain, or up the declivity
of a hill, is deluded into the fancy that it is watching
some great bird upon the wing.</p>

<p class='c016'>There are certain seasons during which the guanaco
is much more difficult to approach than at other times;
but this is true of almost every species of animal,—whether
bird or quadruped. Of course, the tame season
is that of sexual intercourse, when even the wild beasts
become reckless under the influence of passion. At
other times the guanacos are generally very shy; and
sometimes extremely so. It is not uncommon for a herd
of them to take the alarm, and scamper off from the
hunter, even before the latter has approached near
enough to be himself within sight of them! They possess
great keenness of scent, but it is the eye which
usually proves their friend, warning them of the approach
of an enemy—especially if that enemy be a
man upon horseback—before the latter is aware of
their proximity. Often a cloud of dust, rising afar off
over the plain, is the only proof the hunter can obtain,
that there was game within the range of his vision.
It is a curious circumstance connected with hunting
on these great plains,—both on the Pampas and in
Patagonia,—that a man on foot can approach much
nearer to any game than if he were mounted upon a
horse. This is true not only in relation to the guanaco
and ostrich, but also of the large Pampas deer (<i>cervus
campestris</i>); and indeed of almost every animal that
inhabits these regions. The reason is simple enough.
All these creatures are accustomed to seeing their human
enemy only on horseback: for “still hunting,” or hunting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>afoot, is rarely or never practised upon the plains.
Not only that, but a man on foot, would be a rare sight
either to an ostrich or guanaco; and they would scarce
recognize him as an enemy! Curiosity would be their
leading sentiment; and, being influenced by this, the
hunter on foot can often approach them without difficulty.
The Patagonian, knowing this peculiarity, not
infrequently takes advantage of it, to kill or capture
both the bird and the quadruped.</p>

<p class='c016'>This sentiment of the brute creation, on the plains
of Patagonia, is directly the reverse of what may be
observed in our own fields. The sly crow shows but
little of this shyness, so long as you approach it on a
horse’s back; but only attempt to steal up to it on
foot,—even with a thick hawthorn hedge to screen
you,—and every fowler knows how wary the bird
can prove itself. Some people pronounce this <i>instinct</i>.
If so, instinct and reason must be one and the same
thing.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides hunting the guanaco, much of the Patagonian’s
time is spent in the chase of the ostrich; and, to
circumvent this shy creature, he adopts various <i>ruses</i>.
The American ostrich, or more properly <i>rhea</i>, has many
habits in common with its African congener. One of
these is, when pursued it runs in a straight track, and, if
possible, <i>against</i> the wind. Aware of this habit, the
Patagonians pursue it on horseback,—taking the precaution
to place some of their party in ambush in the
direction which the bird is most likely to run. They
then gallop hastily up to the line of flight, and either
intercept the <i>rhea</i> altogether, or succeed in “hoppling”
it with the bolas. The moment these touch its long legs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>both are drawn suddenly together; and the bird goes
down as if shot!</p>

<p class='c016'>Drake and other voyagers have recorded the statement
that the Patagonians attract the rhea within reach,
by disguising themselves in a skin of this bird. This is
evidently an untruth; and the error, whether wilful or
otherwise, derives its origin from the fact, that a stratagem
of the kind is adopted by the Bushmen of Africa
to deceive the ostrich. But what is practicable and possible
between a pigmy Bushman and a gigantic African
ostrich, becomes altogether impracticable and improbable,
when the <i>dramatis personæ</i> are a gigantic Patagonian
and an American <i>rhea</i>. Moreover, it is also
worthy of remark, that the <i>rhea</i> of the Patagonian
plains is not the larger of the two species of American
ostrich, but the smaller one (<i>rhea Darwinii</i>), which
has been lately specifically named after the celebrated
naturalist. And justly does Mr. Darwin merit the honor:
since he was the first to give a scientific description of
the bird. He was not the first, however,—as he appears
himself to believe,—to discover its existence, or
to give a record of it in writing. The old Styrian monk,
Dobrizhoffer, two centuries before Mr. Darwin was born,
in his “History of the Abipones” clearly points to the
fact that there were two distinct species of the “avestruz,”
or South-American ostrich.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Darwin, however, has confirmed Dobrizhoffer’s
account; and brought both birds home with him; and
he, who chooses to reflect upon the subject, will easily
perceive how impossible it would be for a Patagonian
to conceal his bulky <i>corpus</i> under the skin of a <i>rhea
Darwinii</i>, or even that of its larger congener, the <i>rhea</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span><i>Americana</i>. The skin of either would be little more
than large enough to form a cap for the <i>colossus</i> of the
Patagonian plains.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the more fertile parts of Patagonia, the large deer
(<i>cervus campestris</i>) is found. These are also hunted by
the Patagonian, and their flesh is esteemed excellent
food; not, however, until it has lain several days buried
underground,—for it requires this funereal process, to
rid it of the rank, goat-like smell, so peculiar to the
species. The mode of hunting this deer—at least that
most likely to insure success—is by stealing forward to
it on foot.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sometimes a man may approach it, within the distance
of a few yards,—even when there is no cover to shelter
him,—by walking gently up to it. Of all the other
quadrupeds of the Pampas,—and these plains are its
favorite <i>habitat</i>,—the <i>cervus campestris</i> most dreads the
horseman:—since its enemy always appears in that
guise; and it has learnt the destructive power of both
lazo and bolas, by having witnessed their effects upon its
comrades. The hunter dismounted has no terrors for it;
and if he will only keep lazo and bolas out of sight,—for
these it can distinguish, as our crow does the gun,—he
may get near enough to fling either one or the other
with a fatal precision.</p>

<p class='c016'>The “agouti” (<i>cavia Patagonica</i>) frequently furnishes
the Patagonian with a meal. This species is a true
denizen of the desert plains of Patagonia; and forms
one of the characteristic features of their landscape. I
need not describe its generic characters; and specifically
it has been long known as the “Patagonian cavy.” Its
habits differ very little from the other South-American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>animals of this rodent genus,—except that, unlike the
great capivare, it does not affect to dwell near the water.
It is altogether a denizen of dry plains, in which it burrows,
and upon which it may be seen browsing, or hopping
at intervals from one point to another, like a gigantic
rabbit or hare. In fact, the cavies appear to be the
South-American representatives of the hare family,—taking
their place upon all occasions; and, though of
many different species,—according to climate, soil, and
other circumstances,—yet agreeing with the hares in
most of their characteristic habits. So much do some of
the species assimilate to these last, that colonial sportsmen
are accustomed to give them the Old-World appellation
of the celebrated swift-footed rodent. The Patagonian
cavies are much larger than English hares,—one of
them will weigh twenty-five pounds,—but, in other respects,
there is a great deal of resemblance. On a fine
evening, three or four cavies may be seen squatted near
each other, or hopping about over the plains, one following
the other in a direct line, as if they were all proceeding
on the same errand! Just such a habit is frequently
observed among hares and rabbits in a field of young
corn or fallow.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Patagonian boys and women often employ themselves
in seeking out the ostriches’ nests, and robbing
them of their eggs,—which last they find good eating.
In the nests of the smaller species which we have already
stated to be the most common in the Patagonian
country,—they are not rewarded so liberally for their
trouble. Only from sixteen to twenty eggs are hatched
by the <i>rhea Darwinii</i> and about twenty-five to thirty by
the <i>rhea Americana</i>. It will be seen, that this is far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>below the number obtained from the nest of the African
ostrich (<i>struthio camelus</i>),—in which as many as sixty
or seventy eggs are frequently found. It would appear,
therefore, that the greater the size of the bird, belonging
to this genus the greater the number of its brood. Both
the American rheas follow the peculiar habit of the true
ostrich: that is, several hens deposit their eggs in the
same nest; and the male bird assists in the process of
incubation. Indeed, in almost every respect—except
size and general color of plumage—the American and
African ostriches resemble each other very closely; and
there is no reason in the world why a pedantic compiler
should have bestowed upon them distinct generic names.
Both are true <i>camel birds</i>: both alike the offspring, as
they are the ornament, of the desert land.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another occupation in which the Patagonian engages—and
which sometimes rewards him with a meal—is
the snaring of the Pampas partridge (<i>nothuria major</i>).
This is usually the employment of the more youthful
giants; and is performed both on foot and on horseback.
A small species of partridge is taken on foot; but the
larger kind can be snared best from the back of a horse.
The mode is not altogether peculiar to Patagonia: since
it is also practised in other parts of America,—both
north and south,—and the bustard is similarly captured
upon the <i>karoos</i> of Africa. During the noon hours of
the day, the performance takes place: that is, when the
sun no longer casts a shadow. The locality of the bird
being first ascertained, the fowler approaches it, as near
as it will allow. He then commences riding round, and
round, and round,—being all the while watched by the
foolish bird, that, in constantly turning its head, appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>to grow giddy, and loses all dread of danger. The Indian
each moment keeps lessening his circle; or, in other
words, approaches by a spiral line, continually closing
upon its centre. His only weapon is a long light reed,—something
like the common kind of cane fishing-rod,
seen in the hands of rustic youth in our own country. On
the end of this reed he has adjusted a stiff snare; the
noose of which is made from the epidermis of an ostrich
plume, or a piece of the split quill; and which, being
both stiff and elastic, serves admirably for the purpose
for which it is designed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having at length arrived within a proper distance to
reach the beguiled bird, the boy softly stops his horse,
bends gently sideward, and, adroitly passing his noose
over the neck of the partridge, jerks the silly creature
into the air. In this way an Indian boy will capture a
dozen of these birds in a few hours; and might obtain
far more, if the sun would only stay all day in the zenith.
But as the bright orb sinks westward, the elongated
shadow of the horseman passes over the partridge before
the latter is within reach of the snare; and this alarming
the creature, causes it to take flight.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Patagonian builds no house; nor does he remain
long in one place at a time. The sterile soil upon which
he dwells requires him to lead a nomade life; passing
from place to place in search of game. A tent is therefore
his home; and this is of the simplest kind: the tent-cloth
consisting of a number of guanaco skins stitched
together, and the poles being such as he can obtain from
the nearest tract of thicket or <i>chapparal</i>. The poles are
set bow-fashion in the ground, and over these the skin
covering is spread,—one of the bent poles being left uncovered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>to serve as a doorway. Most of the Patagonian’s
time is occupied in procuring game: which, as we
have seen, is his sole sustenance; and when he has any
leisure moments, they are given to the care of his horse,
or to the making or repairing his weapons for the chase.
Above all, the bolas are his especial pride, and ever present
with him. When not in actual use, they are suspended
from his girdle, or tied sash-like around his waist,—the
balls dangling down like a pair of tassels.</p>

<p class='c016'>Only during his hours of sleep, is this national weapon
ever out of the hands of the Patagonian giant. Had
the wonderful giant of our nurseries been provided with
such a sling, it is probable that little Jack would have
found in him an adversary more difficult to subdue!</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>THE FUEGIAN DWARFS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>The great continent of South America, tapering like
a tongue to the southward, ends abruptly on the Straits
of Magellan. These straits may be regarded as a sort
of natural canal, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific
Ocean, winding between high rocky shores, and
indented with numerous bays and inlets. Though the
water is of great depth, the Straits themselves are so
narrow that a ship passing through need never lose
sight of land on either side; and in many places a shell,
projected from an ordinary howitzer, would pitch clear
across them from shore to shore! The country extending
northward from these straits is, as already seen,
called <i>Patagonia</i>; that which lies on their southern
side is the famed “land of fire,” <i>Tierra del Fuego</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>The canal, or channel, of the Straits of Magellan
does not run in a direct line from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. On the contrary, a ship entering from the
former, instead of passing due west, must first run in
a southwest direction,—rather more south than west.
This course will continue, until the ship is about half-way
between the two oceans. She will then head almost
at a right angle to her former course; and keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>this direction—which is nearly due northwest—until
she emerges into the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c016'>It will thus be seen, that the Straits form an angle
near their middle; and the point of land which projects
into the vertex of this angle, and known to navigators
as Cape Forward, is the most southern land of the
American <i>continent</i>. Of course this is not meant to
apply to the most southern point of American land,—since
Tierra del Fuego must be considered as part of
South America. The far-famed “Cape Horn” is the
part of America nearest to the South Pole; and this is
a promontory on one of the small elevated islands lying
off the southern coast of Tierra del Fuego itself. Tierra
del Fuego was for a long time regarded as a single
island; though, even in the voyage of Magellan, several
large inlets, that resembled channels, were observed
running into the land; and it was suspected by that
navigator, that these inlets might be passages leading
through to the ocean. Later surveys have proved that
the conjectures of the Spano-Portuguese voyager were
well founded; and it is now known that instead of a
single island, the country called Tierra del Fuego is a
congeries of many islands, of different shapes and sizes,—separated
from one another by deep and narrow
channels, or arms of the sea, with an endless ramification
of sounds and inlets. In the western part—and
occupying more than three fourths of their whole territory—these
close-lying islands are nothing else than
mountains,—several of them rising five thousand feet
above the level of the water, and stepping directly down
to it, without any foot-hills intervening! Some of them
have their lower declivities covered with sombre forests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>while, farther up, nothing appears but the bare brown
rocks, varied with blue glaciers, or mottled with masses
of snow. The more elevated peaks are covered with
snow that never melts; since their summits rise considerably
above the snow-line of this cold region.</p>

<p class='c016'>These mountain-islands of Tierra del Fuego continue
on to Cape Horn, and eastward to the Straits of Le
Maire, and the bleak islet of Staaten Land. They may,
in fact, be considered as the continuation of the great
chain of the Andes, if we regard the intersecting channels—including
that of Magellan itself—as mere clefts
or ravines, the bottoms of which, lying below the level
of the sea, have been filled with sea-water. Indeed, we
may rationally take this view of the case: since these
channels bear a very great resemblance to the stupendous
ravines termed “barrancas” and “quebradas,”
which intersect the Cordilleras of the Andes in other
parts of South America,—as also in the northern division
of the American continent.</p>

<p class='c016'>Regarding the Straits of Magellan, then, and the
other channels of Tierra del Fuego, as great <i>water-barrancas</i>,
we may consider the Andes as terminating at
Cape Horn itself, or rather at Staaten Land: since that
island is a still more distant extension of this, the longest
chain of mountains on the globe.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another point may be here adduced, in proof of the
rationality of this theory. The western, or mountainous
part of Tierra del Fuego bears a strong resemblance to
the western section of the continent,—that is, the part
occupied by the Andes. For a considerable distance to
the north of the Magellan Straits, nearly one half of
the continental land is of a mountainous character. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>is also indented by numerous sounds and inlets, resembling
those of Tierra del Fuego; while the mountains
that hang over these deep-water ravines are either timbered,
or bare of trees and snow-covered, exhibiting
glacier valleys, like those farther south. The whole
physical character is similar; and, what is a still more
singular fact, we find that in the western, or mountainous
part of Patagonia, there are no true Patagonians;
but that there the water-Indians, or Fuegians, frequent
the creeks and inlets.</p>

<p class='c016'>Again, upon the east,—or rather northeast of Tierra
del Fuego,—that angular division of it, which lies to
the north of the Sabastian channel presents us with
physical features that correspond more nearly with those
of the plains of Patagonia; and upon this part we find
tribes of Indians that beyond doubt are true Patagonians,—and
not Fuegians, as they have been described. This
will account for the fact that some navigators have seen
people on the Fuegian side that were large-bodied men,
clothed in guanaco skins, and exhibiting none of those
wretched traits which characterize the Fuegians; while,
on the other hand, miserable, stunted men are known to
occupy the mountainous western part of Patagonia. It
amounts to this,—that the Patagonians <i>have</i> crossed the
Straits of Magellan; and it is this people, and not Fuegians,
who are usually seen upon the champaign lands
north of the Sebastian channel. Even the guanaco has
crossed at the same place,—for this quadruped, as well
as a species of deer, is found in the eastern division of
Tierra del Fuego. Perhaps it was the camel-sheep—which
appears to be almost a necessity of the Patagonian’s
existence—that first induced these water-hating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>giants to make so extensive a voyage as that of crossing
the Straits at Cape Orange!</p>

<p class='c016'>At Cape Orange the channel is so narrow, one might
fancy that the Patagonians, if they possessed one half
the pedestrian stretch attributed to the giants of old,
might have stepped from shore to shore without wetting
their great feet!</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps there are no two people on earth, living so
near each other as the Patagonians and Fuegians, who
are more unlike. Except in the color of the skin and
hair, there is hardly a point of resemblance between
them. The former seems to hate the sea: at all events
he never goes out upon, nor even approaches its shore,
except in pursuit of such game as may wander that
way. He neither dwells near, nor does he draw any
portion of his subsistence from the waters of the great
deep,—fish constituting no part of his food.</p>

<p class='c016'>All this is directly the reverse with the Fuegian.
The beach is the situation <i>he</i> chooses for his dwelling-place,
and the sea or its shore is his proper element.
He is more than half his time, either on it, or <i>in</i> it,—on
it in his canoe, and in it, while wading among the
tidal shoals in search of fish, muscles, and limpets, which
constitute very nearly the whole of his subsistence.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is very curious, therefore, while noting the difference
between these two tribes of Indians, to observe
how each confines its range to that part of the Magellanic
land that appears best adapted to their own peculiar
habits,—those of the Patagonian being altogether
<i>terrestrial</i>, while those of the Fuegian are essentially
<i>aquatic</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have stated elsewhere the limits of the Patagonian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>territory; and shown that, ethnologically speaking,
they do not occupy the whole northern shore of the
Magellan Straits, but only the eastern half of it. Westward
towards the Pacific the aspect of the land, on both
sides of this famous channel, may be regarded as of the
same character, though altogether different from that
which is seen at the entrance, or eastern end.</p>

<p class='c016'>West of Cape Negro on one side, and the Sebastian
passage on the other, bleak mountain summits, with narrow
wooded valleys intervening, become the characteristic
features. There we behold an incongruous labyrinth
of peaks and ridges, of singular and fantastic forms,—many
of them reaching above the limits of perpetual
snow,—which, in this cold climate descends to the
height of four thousand feet. We have seen that these
mountains are separated from each other,—not by
plains, nor even valleys, in the ordinary understanding
of the term; but by <i>ravines</i>, the steep sides of which
are covered with sombre forests up to a height of one
thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea:
at which point vegetation terminates with a uniformity
as exact as that of the snow-line itself! These forests
grow out of a wet, peaty soil,—in many places impassable
on account of its boggy nature; and of this character
is almost the whole surface of the different islands.
The trees composing the forests are few in species,—those
of the greatest size and numbers being the “winter’s
bark” (<i>drymys</i>), of the order <i>magnoliacæ</i>, a birch,
and, more abundantly, a species of beech-tree, the <i>fagus
betuloides</i>. These last-named trees are many of them
of great size; and might almost be called evergreens:
since they retain part of their foliage throughout the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>whole year; but it would be more appropriate to style
them <i>ever-yellows</i>: since at no period do they exhibit a
verdure, anything like the forests of other countries.
They are always clad in the same sombre livery of dull
yellow, rendering the mountain landscape around them,
if possible, more dreary and desolate.</p>

<p class='c016'>The forests of Tierra del Fuego are essentially worthless
forests; their timber offering but a limited contribution
to the necessities of man, and producing scarce any
food for his subsistence.</p>

<p class='c016'>Many of the ravines are so deep as to end, as already
stated, in becoming arms or inlets of the sea; while others
again are filled up with stupendous glaciers, that appear
like cataracts suddenly arrested in their fall, by
being frozen into solid ice! Most of these inlets are of
great depth,—so deep that the largest ship may plough
through them with safety. They intersect the islands in
every direction,—cutting them up into numerous peninsulas
of the most fantastic forms; while some of the
channels are narrow <i>sounds</i>, and stretch across the land
of Tierra del Fuego from ocean to ocean.</p>

<p class='c016'>The “Land of Fire” is therefore not an island,—as
it was long regarded,—but rather a collection of islands,
terminated by precipitous cliffs that frown within gun-shot
of each other. Ofttimes vast masses of rock, or
still larger masses of glacier ice, fall from these cliffs
into the profound abysses of the inlets below; the concussion,
as they strike the water, reverberating to the
distance of miles; while the water itself, stirred to its
lowest depths, rises in grand surging waves, that often
engulf the canoe of the unwary savage.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Tierra del Fuego” is simply the Spanish phrase for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>“Land of Fire.” It was so called by Magellan on
account of the numerous fires seen at night upon its
shores,—while he and his people were passing through
the Straits. These were signal fires, kindled by the
natives,—no doubt to telegraph to one another the
arrival of those strange leviathans, the Spanish ships,
then seen by them for the first time.</p>

<p class='c016'>The name is inappropriate. A more fit appellation
would be the “land of water;” for, certainly, in no
part of the earth is water more abundant: both rain
and snow supplying it almost continually. Water is the
very plague of the island; it lies stagnant or runs everywhere,—forming
swamps, wherever there is a spot of
level ground, and rendering even the declivities of the
mountains as spongy as a peat-bog.</p>

<p class='c016'>The climate throughout the whole year is excessively
cold; for, though the winter is perhaps not more rigorous
than in the same latitude of a northern land, yet
the summer is almost as severe as the winter; and it
would be a misnomer to call it summer at all. Snow
falls throughout the whole year; and even in the midsummer
of Tierra del Fuego men have actually perished
from cold, at no great elevation above the level of the
sea!</p>

<p class='c016'>Under these circumstances, it would scarce be expected
that Tierra del Fuego should be inhabited,—either
by men or animals of any kind; but no country
has yet been reached, too cold for the existence of both.
No part of the earth seems to have been created in vain;
and both men and beasts are found dwelling under the
chill skies of Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p class='c016'>The land-animals, as well as the birds, are few in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>species, as in numbers. The <i>guanaco</i> is found upon the
islands; but whether indigenous, or carried across from
the Patagonian shore, can never be determined: since it
was an inhabitant of the islands long anterior to the
arrival of Magellan. It frequents only the eastern side
of the cluster,—where the ground is firmer, and a few
level spots appear that might be termed plains or meadows.
A species of deer inhabits the same districts;
and besides these, there are two kinds of fox-wolves
(<i>canis Megellanicus</i> and <i>canis Azaræ</i>), three or four
kinds of mice, and a species of bat.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of water-<i>mammalia</i> there is a greater abundance;
these comprising the whale, seals, sea-lions, and the
sea-otter.</p>

<p class='c016'>But few birds have been observed; only the white-tufted
flycatcher, a large black woodpecker with scarlet
crest, a creeper, a wren, a thrush, a starling, hawks,
owls, and four or five kinds of finches.</p>

<p class='c016'>The water-birds, like the water-<i>mammalia</i>, muster in
greater numbers. Of these there are ducks of various
kinds, sea-divers, and penguins, the albatross, and sheer-water,
and, more beautiful than all, the “painted” or
“Magellan goose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Reptiles do not exist, and insects are exceedingly
rare. A few flies and butterflies are seen; but the
mosquito—the plague of other parts of South America—does
not venture into the cold, humid atmosphere of
the Land of Fire.</p>

<p class='c016'>We now arrive at the <i>human</i> inhabitants of this desolate
region.</p>

<p class='c016'>As might be expected, these exhibit no very high
condition of either physical or mental development but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>the contrary. The character of their civilization is in
complete correspondence with that of their dreary dwelling-place,—at
the very bottom of the scale. Yes, at
the very bottom, according to most ethnologists; even
lower down than that of the Digger Indian, the Andaman
islander, the Bushman of Africa, or the Esquimaux
of the Arctic Ocean: in fact, any comparison of a Fuegian
with the last-mentioned would be ridiculous, as
regards either their moral or physical condition. Below
the Esquimaux, the Fuegian certainly is, and by many
a long degree.</p>

<p class='c016'>In height, the tallest Fuegian stands about five feet,—not
in his boots, for he wears none; but on his naked
soles. His wife is just six inches shorter than himself,—a
difference which is not a bad proportion between
the sexes, but in other respects they are much alike.
Both have small, misshapen limbs, with large knee-caps,
and but little calf; both have long masses of coarse
tangled hair, hanging like bunches of black snakes over
their shoulders; and both are as naked as the hour in
which they were born,—unless we call <i>that</i> a dress,—that
bit of stinking seal-skin which is slung at the back,
and covers about a fifth part of the whole body! Hairy
side turned inward, it extends only from the nape of the
neck to a few inches below the hollow of the back; and
is fastened in front by means of a thong or skewer passing
over the breast. It is rarely so ample as to admit
of being “skewered;” and with this scanty covering,
in rain and snow, frost and blow,—some one of which
is continuously going on,—the shivering wretch is contented.
Nay, more; if there should happen an interval
of mild weather, or the wearer be at work in paddling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>his canoe, he flings this unique garment aside, as if its
warmth were an incumbrance! When the weather is
particularly cold, he shifts the seal-skin to that side of
his body which may chance to be exposed to the blast!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Fuegian wears neither hat, nor shirt, waistcoat,
nor breeches,—no shoes, no stockings,—nothing intended
for clothing but the bit of stinking skin. His
vanity, however, is exhibited, if not in his dress, to some
extent in his adornments. Like all savages and many
civilized people, he <i>paints</i> certain portions of his person;
and his “escutcheon” is peculiar. It would be difficult
detail its complicated labyrinth of “crossings” and
“quarterings.” We shall content ourselves by stating
that black lines and blotches upon a white ground constitute
its chief characteristic. Red, too, is sometimes
seen, of a dark or “bricky” color. The black is simply
charcoal; while the white-ground coat is obtained from
a species of infusorial clay, which he finds at the bottom
of the peaty streams, that pour down the ravines of the
mountains. As additional ornaments, he wears strings
of fish-teeth, or pieces of bone, about his wrists and
ankles. His wife carries the same upon her neck; and
both, when they can procure it, tie a plain band around
the head, of a reddish-brown color,—the material of
which is the long hair of the guanaco. The “cloak,”
already described, is sometimes of sea-otter instead of
seal-skin; and on some of the islands, where the deer
dwells, the hide of that animal affords a more ample
covering. In most cases, however, the size of the garment
is that of a pocket handkerchief; and affords about
as much protection against the weather as a kerchief
would.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>Though the Fuegian has abundance of hair upon his
head, there is none, or almost none on any part of his
body. He is beardless and whiskerless as an Esquimaux;
though his features,—without the adornment
of hair,—are sufficiently fierce in their expression.</p>

<p class='c016'>He not only looks ferocious, but in reality is so,—deformed
in mind, as he is hideous in person. He is not
only ungrateful for kindness done, but unwilling to remember
it; and he is cruel and vindictive in the extreme.
Beyond a doubt he is a <i>cannibal</i>; not habitually
perhaps, but in times of scarcity and famine,—a true
cannibal, for he does not confine himself to eating his
<i>enemies</i>, but his <i>friends</i>, if need be,—and especially the
old women of his tribe, who fall the first victims, in those
crises produced by the terrible requirements of an impending
starvation. Unfortunately the fact is too well
authenticated to admit of either doubt or denial; and,
even while we write, the account of a massacre of a
ship’s crew by these hostile savages is going the rounds
of the press,—that ship, too, a missionary vessel, that
had landed on their shores with the humane object of
ameliorating their condition.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course such unnatural food is only partaken of at
long and rare intervals,—by many communities never,—and
there is no proof that the wretched Fuegian has
acquired an appetite for it: like the Feegee and some
other savage tribes. It is to be hoped that he indulges
in the horrid habit, only when forced to it by the necessities
of extreme hunger.</p>

<p class='c016'>His ordinary subsistence is shell-fish; though he eats
also the flesh of the seal and sea-otter; of birds, especially
the penguin and Magellanic goose, when he can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>capture them. His stomach will not “turn” at the blubber
of a whale,—when by good chance one of these
leviathans gets stranded on his coast,—even though the
great carcass be far gone in the stages of decomposition!
The only vegetable diet in which he indulges is the
berry of a shrub—a species of arbutus—which grows
abundantly on the peaty soil; and a fungus of a very
curious kind, that is produced upon the trunks of the
beech-tree. This fungus is of a globular form, and pale-yellow
color. When young, it is elastic and turgid, with
a smooth surface; but as it matures it becomes shrunken,
grows tougher in its texture, and presents the pitted appearance
of a honeycomb. When fully ripe, the Fuegians
collect it in large quantities, eating it without cooking
or other preparation. It is tough between the teeth;
but soon changes into pulp, with a sweetish taste and
flavor,—somewhat resembling that of our common mushroom.</p>

<p class='c016'>These two vegetables—a berry and a cryptogamic
plant—are almost the only ones eaten by the natives
of Tierra del Fuego. There are others upon the island
that might enable them to eke out their miserable existence:
there are two especially sought after by such
Europeans as visit this dreary land,—the “wild celery”
(<i>apium antarcticum</i>), and the “scurvy grass” (<i>cardamine
antiscorbutica</i>); but for these the Fuegian cares
not. He even knows not their uses.</p>

<p class='c016'>In speaking of other “odd people,” I have usually
described the mode of building their house; but about
the house of the Fuegian I have almost “no story to
tell.” It would be idle to call that a house, which far
more resembles the lair of a wild beast; and is, in reality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>little better than the den made by the orang-outang
in the forests of Borneo. Such as it is, however
I shall describe it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having procured a number of long saplings or branches,—not
always straight ones,—the Fuegian sharpens
them at one end by means of his muscle-shell knife; and
then sticking the sharpened ends into the ground in a
kind of circle, he brings the tops all together, and ties
them in a bunch,—so as to form a rude hemispherical
frame. Upon this he lays some smaller branches; and
over these a few armfuls of long coarse grass, and the
house is “built.” One side—that to leeward of the
prevailing wind—is left open, to allow for an entrance
and the escape of smoke. As this opening is usually
about an eighth part of the whole circumference, the
house is, in reality, nothing more than a shed or lair.
Its furniture does not contradict the idea; but, on the
contrary, only strengthens the comparison. There is no
table, no chair, no bedstead: a “shake-down” of damp
grass answers for all. There are no implements or
utensils,—if we except a rude basket used for holding
the arbutus berries, and a seal-skin bag, in which the
shell-fish are collected. A bladder, filled with water,
hangs upon some forking stuck against the side: in the
top of this bladder is a hole, from which each member
of the family takes a “suck,” when thirst inclines them
to drink!</p>

<p class='c016'>The “tools” observable are a bow and arrow, the latter
headed with flint; a fish spear with a forked point,
made from a bone of the sea-lion; a short stick,—a
woman’s implement for knocking the limpets from the
rocks; and some knives, the blades of which are sharpened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>shells of the muscle,—a very large species of which
is found along the coast. These knives are simply manufactured.
The brittle edge of the shell—which is five
or six inches in length—is first chipped off, and a
new edge formed by grinding the shell upon the rocks.
When thus prepared, it will cut not only the hardest
wood, but even the bones of fish; and serves the Fuegian
for all purposes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Outside the hut, you may see the canoe,—near at
hand too,—for the shieling of the Fuegian universally
stands upon the beach. He never dwells in the interior
of his island; and but rarely roams there,—the women
only making such excursions as are necessary to procure
the berry and the mushroom. The woods have no
charms for him, except to afford him a little fuel; they
are difficult to be traversed on account of the miry soil
out of which the trees grow; and, otherwise, there is
absolutely nothing to be found amidst their gloomy
depths, that would in any way contribute to his comfort
or sustenance. He is therefore essentially a dweller on
the shore; and even there he is not free to come and go
as he might choose. From the bold character of his
coast, there are here and there long reaches, where the
beach cannot be followed by land,—places where the
water’s edge can only be reached, and the shell-fish collected,
by means of some sort of navigable craft. For
this purpose the Fuegian requires a canoe; and the
necessity of his life makes him a waterman. His skill,
however, both in the construction of his craft, and the
management of it, is of a very inferior order,—infinitely
inferior to that exhibited either by the Esquimaux
or the Water-Indians of the North.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>His canoe is usually made of the bark of a tree,—the
birch already mentioned. Sometimes it is so rudely
shaped, as to be merely a large piece of bark shelled
from a single trunk, closed at each end, and tied tightly
with thong of seal-skin. A few cross-sticks prevent the
sides from pressing inward; while as many stays of
thong keep them from “bulging” in the contrary direction.
If there are cracks in the bark, these are calked
with rushes and a species of resin, which the woods
furnish.</p>

<p class='c016'>With this rude vessel the Fuegian ventures forth,
upon the numerous straits and inlets that intersect his
land; but he rarely trusts himself to a tempestuous
sea.</p>

<p class='c016'>If rich or industrious, he sometimes becomes the possessor
of a craft superior to this. It is also a bark canoe,
but not made of a single “flitch.” On the contrary,
there are many choice pieces used in its construction:
for it is fifteen feet in length and three in width amidships.
Its “build” also is better,—with a high prow
and stern, and cross-pieces regularly set and secured at
the ends. The pieces of bark are united by a stitching
of thongs; and the seams carefully calked, so that
no water can enter. In this vessel, the Fuegian may
embark with his whole family,—and his whole furniture
to boot,—and voyage to any part of his coast
And this in reality he does; for the “shanty” above
described, is to him only a temporary home. The
necessities of his life require him to be continually
changing it; and a “removal,” with the building of
a new domicile, is a circumstance of frequent recurrence.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>Not unfrequently, in removing from one part of the
coast to another, he finds it safer making a land-journey,
to avoid the dangers of the deep. In times of high
wind, it is necessary for him to adopt this course,—else
his frail bark might be dashed against the rocks and
riven to pieces. In the land-journey he carries the
canoe along with him; and in order to do this with
convenience, he has so contrived it, that the planks composing
the little vessel can be taken apart, and put together
again without much difficulty,—the seams only
requiring to be freshly calked. In the transport across
land, each member of the family carries a part of
the canoe: the stronger individuals taking the heavier
pieces,—as the side and bottom planks,—while the
ribs and light beams are borne by the younger and
weaker.</p>

<p class='c016'>The necessity of removal arises from a very natural
cause. A few days spent at a particular place,—on a
creek or bay,—even though the community be a small
one, soon exhausts the chief store of food,—the muscle-bank
upon the beach,—and, of course, another must
be sought for. This may lie at some distance; perhaps
can only be reached by a tedious, and sometimes perilous
water-journey; and under these circumstances the Fuegian
deems it less trouble to carry the mountain to Mahomet,
than carry Mahomet so often to the mountain.
The transporting his whole <i>ménage</i>, is just as easy
as bringing home a load of limpets; and as to the
building of a new house, that is a mere bagatelle, which
takes little labor, and no more time than the erection of
a tent. Some Fuegians actually possess a tent, covered
with the skins of animals; but this is a rare and exceptional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>advantage; and the tent itself of the rudest kind
The Fuegian has his own mode of procuring fire. He
is provided with a piece of “mundic,” or iron pyrites
which he finds high up upon the sides of his mountains.
This struck by a pebble will produce sparks. These he
catches upon a tinder of moss, or the “punk” of a dead
tree, which he knows how to prepare. The tinder once
ignited, is placed within a roundish ball of dry grass;
and, this being waved about in circles, sets the grass in
a blaze. It is then only necessary to communicate the
flame to a bundle of sticks; and the work is complete.
The process, though easy enough in a climate where
“punk” is plenty, and dry grass and sticks can be
readily procured, is nevertheless difficult enough in the
humid atmosphere of Tierra del Fuego,—where moss
is like a wet sponge, and grass, sticks, and logs, can
hardly be found dry enough to burn. Well knowing
this, the Fuegian is habitually careful of his fire: scarce
ever permitting it to go out; and even while travelling
in his canoe, in search of a “new home,” side by side
with his other “penates” he carries the fire along with
him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding the abundance of fuel with which
his country provides him, he seems never to be thoroughly
warm. Having no close walls to surround him,
and no clothing to cover his body, he suffers almost incessantly
from cold. Wherever met, he presents himself
with a shivering aspect, like one undergoing a severe
fit of the ague!</p>

<p class='c016'>The Fuegians live in small communities, which scarce
deserve the name of “tribes:” since they have no political
leader, nor chief of any description. The conjuror—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>they have him—is the only individual
that differs in any degree from the other members of the
community; but his power is very slight and limited;
nor does it extend to the exercise of any physical force.
Religion they have none,—at least, none more sacred
or sanctified than a vague belief in devils and other
evil spirits.</p>

<p class='c016'>Although without leaders, they are far from being a
peaceful people. The various communities often quarrel
and wage cruel and vindictive war against one another;
and were it not that the boundaries of each association
are well defined, by deep ravines and inlets of the sea,
as well as by the impassable barriers of snow-covered
mountains, these warlike dwarfs would thin one another’s
numbers to a far greater extent than they now do,—perhaps
to a mutual extermination. Fortunately the
peculiar nature of their country hinders them from coming
very often within fighting distance.</p>

<p class='c016'>Their whole system of life is abject in the extreme.
Although provided with fires, their food is eaten raw;
and a fish taken from the water will be swallowed upon
the instant,—almost before the life is gone out of it.
Seal and penguin flesh are devoured in the same manner;
and the blubber of the whale is also a raw repast.
When one of these is found dead upon the beach,—for
they have neither the skill nor courage to capture the
whale,—the lucky accident brings a season of rejoicing
A fleet of canoes—if it is to be reached only by water—at
once paddle towards the place; or, if it be an
overland journey, the whole community—man, woman,
and child—start forth on foot. In an hour or two they
may be seen returning to their hut-village, each with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>large “flitch” of blubber flapping over the shoulders,
and the head just appearing above, through a hole cut
in the centre of the piece,—just as a Mexican ranchero
wears his “serape,” or a denizen of the Pampas his
woollen “poncho.” A feast follows this singular procession.</p>

<p class='c016'>Like the Esquimaux of the north, the Fuegian is
very skilful in capturing the seal. His mode of capturing
this creature, however, is very different from
that employed by the “sealer” of the Arctic Seas;
and consists simply in stealing as near as possible in his
canoe, when he sees the animal asleep upon the surface,
and striking it with a javelin,—which he throws with
an unerring aim.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have already observed that the principal subsistence
of the Fuegian is supplied by the sea; and
shell-fish forms the most important item of his food.
These are muscles, limpets, oysters, and other kinds of
shell-fish, and so many are annually consumed by a
single family, that an immense heap of the shells may
be seen not only in front of every hut, but all along the
coast of the islands, above high-water mark,—wherever
a tribe has made its temporary sojourn.</p>

<p class='c016'>There is a singular fact connected with these conglomerations
of shells, which appears to have escaped
the observations of the Magellanic voyagers. It is not
by mere accident they are thus collected in piles. There
is a certain amount of superstition in the matter. The
Fuegian believes that, were the shells scattered negligently
about, ill-luck would follow; and, above all, if
the emptied ones were thrown back into the sea: since
this would be a warning of destruction that would frighten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>the living bivalves in their “beds,” and drive them
away from the coast! Hence it is that the shell-heaps
are so carefully kept together.</p>

<p class='c016'>In collecting these shell-fish, the women are the chief
laborers. They do not always gather them from the
rocks, after the tide has gone out; though that is the
usual time. But there are some species not found in
shallow water, and therefore only to be obtained by
diving to the bottom after them. Of this kind is a
species of <i>echinus</i>, or “sea-urchin,” of the shape of an
orange, and about twice the bulk of one,—the whole
outside surface being thickly set with spines, or protuberances.
These curious shell-fish are called “sea-eggs”
by the sailor navigators; and constitute an important
article of the food of the Fuegian. It is often necessary
to dive for them to a great depth; and this is
done by the Fuegian women, who are as expert in
plunging as the pearl-divers of California or the Indian
seas.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fish is another article of Fuegian diet; and many
kinds are captured upon their coasts, some of excellent
quality. They sometimes obtain the fish by shooting
them with their arrows, or striking them with a dart;
but they have a mode of catching the finny creatures,
which is altogether peculiar: that is to say, <i>hunting
them with dogs</i>! The Fuegians possess a breed
of small fox-like dogs, mean, wretched looking curs,
usually on the very verge of starvation,—since their
owners take not the slightest care of them, and hardly
ever trouble themselves about feeding them. Notwithstanding
this neglect, the Fuegian dogs are not without
certain good qualities; and become important auxiliaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>to the Fuegian fisherman. They are trained to pursue
the fish through the water, and drive them into a net,
or some enclosed creek or inlet, shallow enough for them
to be shot with the arrow. In doing this the dogs dive
to the bottom; and follow the fish to and fro, as if they
were amphibious carnivora, like the seals and otters.
For this useful service the poor brutes receive a very
inadequate reward,—getting only the bones as their
portion. They would undoubtedly starve, were it not
that, being left to shift for themselves, they have learnt
how to procure their own food; and understand how to
catch a fish now and then <i>on their own account</i>. Their
principal food, however, consists in shell-fish, which they
find along the shores, with polypi, and such other animal
substances as the sea leaves uncovered upon the beach
after the tide has retired. A certain kind of sea-weed
also furnishes them with an occasional meal, as it does
their masters,—often as hungry and starving as themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'>In his personal habits no human being is more filthy
than the Fuegian. He never uses water for washing
purposes; nor cleans the dirt from his skin in any way.
He has no more idea of putting water to such use, than
he has of drowning himself in it; and in respect to
cleanliness, he is not only below most other savages,
but below the brutes themselves: since even these are
taught cleanliness by instinct. But no such instinct
exists in the mind of the Fuegian; and he lives in the
midst of filth. The smell of his body can be perceived
at a considerable distance; and Hotspur’s fop might
have had reasonable grounds of complaint, had it been
a Fuegian who came between the “wind and his nobility.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>To use the pithy language of one of the old
navigators, “The Fuegian stinks like a fox.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Fairly examined, then, in all his bearings,—fairly
judged by his habits and actions,—the Fuegian may
claim the credit of being the most wretched of our
race.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
